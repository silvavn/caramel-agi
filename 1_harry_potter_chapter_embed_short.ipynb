”\\n “ Did you see his scar ? ”\\n Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day .\\n People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him , or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again , staring .\\n Harry wished they wouldn’t , because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes .\\n There were a hundred and forty two staircases at Hogwarts : wide , sweeping ones narrow , rickety ones some that led somewhere different on a Friday some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump .\\n Then there were doors that wouldn’t open unless you asked politely , or tickled them in exactly the right place , and doors that weren’t really doors at all , but solid walls just pretending .\\n It was also very hard to remember where anything was , because it all seemed to move around a lot .\\n The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other , and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk .\\n The ghosts didn’t help , either .\\n It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open .\\n Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction , but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class .\\n He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head , pull rugs from under your feet , pelt you with bits of chalk , or sneak up behind you , invisible , grab your nose , and screech , “ GOT YOUR CONK ! ”\\n Even worse than Peeves , if that was possible , was the caretaker , Argus Filch .\\n Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning .\\n Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out of bounds corridor on the third floor .\\n He wouldn’t believe they were lost , was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose , and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell , who was passing .\\n Filch owned a cat called Mrs Norris , a scrawny , dust colored creature with bulging , lamplike eyes just like Filch’s .\\n She patrolled the corridors alone .\\n Break a rule in front of her , put just one toe out of line , and she’d whisk off for Filch , who’d appear , wheezing , two seconds later .\\n Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone ( except perhaps the Weasley twins ) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts .\\n The students all hated him , and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs Norris a good kick .\\n And then , once you had managed to find them , there were the classes themselves .\\n There was a lot more to magic , as Harry quickly found out , than waving your wand and saying a few funny words .\\n They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets .\\n Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology , with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout , where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi , and found out what they were used for .\\n Easily the most boring class was History of Magic , which was the only one taught by a ghost .\\n Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach , leaving his body behind him .\\n Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates , and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up .\\n Professor Flitwick , the Charms teacher , was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk .\\n At the start of their first class he took the roll call , and when he reached Harry’s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight .\\n Professor McGonagall was again different .\\n Harry had been quite right to think she wasn’t a teacher to cross .\\n Strict and clever , she gave them a talking to the moment they sat down in her first class .\\n “ Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts , ” she said .\\n “ Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back .\\n You have been warned . ”\\n Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again .\\n They were all very impressed and couldn’t wait to get started , but soon realized they weren’t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time .\\n After taking a lot of complicated notes , they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle .\\n By the end of the lesson , only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile .\\n The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts , but Quirrell’s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke .\\n His classroom smelled strongly of garlic , which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he’d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days .\\n His turban , he told them , had been given to him by an African prince as a thank you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie , but they weren’t sure they believed this story .\\n For one thing , when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie , Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather for another , they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban , and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well , so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went .\\n Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn’t miles behind everyone else .\\n Lots of people had come from Muggle families and , like him , hadn’t had any idea that they were witches and wizards .\\n There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn’t have much of a head start .\\n Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron .\\n They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once .\\n “ What have we got today ? ”\\n Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge .\\n “ Double Potions with the Slytherins , ” said Ron .\\n “ Snape’s Head of Slytherin House .\\n They say he always favors them we’ll be able to see if it’s true . ”\\n “ Wish McGonagall favored us , ” said Harry .\\n Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House , but it hadn’t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before .\\n Just then , the mail arrived .\\n Harry had gotten used to this by now , but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning , when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast , circling the tables until they saw their owners , and dropping letters and packages onto their laps .\\n Hedwig hadn’t brought Harry anything so far .\\n She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls .\\n This morning , however , she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry’s plate .\\n Harry tore it open at once .\\n It said , in a very untidy scrawl : Dear Harry , I know you get Friday afternoons off so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three ?\\n I want to hear all about your first week .\\n Send us an answer back with Hedwig .\\n Hagrid Harry borrowed Ron’s quill , scribbled Yes , please , see you later on the back of the note , and sent Hedwig off again .\\n It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to , because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far .\\n At the start of term banquet , Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him .\\n By the end of the first Potions lesson , he knew he’d been wrong .\\n Snape didn’t dislike Harry he hated him .\\n Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons .\\n It was colder here than up in the main castle , and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls .\\n Snape , like Flitwick , started the class by taking the roll call , and like Flitwick , he paused at Harry’s name .\\n “ Ah , yes , ” he said softly , “ Harry Potter .\\n Our new celebrity . ”\\n Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands .\\n Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class .\\n His eyes were black like Hagrid ’ s , but they had none of Hagrid ’ s warmth .\\n They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels .\\n “ You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion making , ” he began .\\n He spoke in barely more than a whisper , but they caught every word like Professor McGonagall , Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort .\\n “ As there is little foolish wand waving here , many of you will hardly believe this is magic .\\n I don’t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes , the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins , bewitching the mind , ensnaring the senses .\\n I can teach you how to bottle fame , brew glory , even stopper death if you aren’t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach . ”\\n More silence followed this little speech .\\n Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows .\\n Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn’t a dunderhead .\\n “ Potter ! ”\\n said Snape suddenly .\\n “ What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood ? ”\\n Powdered root of what to an infusion of what ?\\n Harry glanced at Ron , who looked as stumped as he was Hermione ’ s hand had shot into the air .\\n “ I don’t know , sir , ” said Harry .\\n Snape ’ s lips curled into a sneer .\\n “ Tut , tut fame clearly isn’t everything . ”\\n He ignored Hermione ’ s hand .\\n “ Let’s try again .\\n Potter , where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar ? ”\\n Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat , but Harry didn’t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was .\\n He tried not to look at Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle , who were shaking with laughter .\\n “ I don’t know , sir . ”\\n “ Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming , eh , Potter ? ”\\n Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes .\\n He had looked through his books at the Dursleys ’ , but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi ?\\n Snape was still ignoring Hermione’s quivering hand .\\n “ What is the difference , Potter , between monkshood and wolfsbane ? ”\\n At this , Hermione stood up , her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling .\\n “ I don’t know , ” said Harry quietly .\\n “ I think Hermione does , though , why don’t you try her ? ”\\n A few people laughed Harry caught Seamus’s eye , and Seamus winked .\\n Snape , however , was not pleased .\\n “ Sit down , ” he snapped at Hermione .\\n “ For your information , Potter , asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death .\\n A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons .\\n As for monkshood and wolfsbane , they are the same plant , which also goes by the name of aconite .\\n Well ?\\n Why aren’t you all copying that down ? ”\\n There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment .\\n Over the noise , Snape said , “ And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek , Potter . ”\\n Things didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued .\\n Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils .\\n He swept around in his long black cloak , watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs , criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy , whom he seemed to like .\\n He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon .\\n Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted blob , and their potion was seeping across the stone floor , burning holes in people’s shoes .\\n Within seconds , the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville , who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed , moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs .\\n “ Idiot boy ! ”\\n snarled Snape , clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand .\\n “ I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire ? ”\\n Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose .\\n “ Take him up to the hospital wing , ” Snape spat at Seamus .\\n Then he rounded on Harry and Ron , who had been working next to Neville .\\n “ You Potter why didn’t you tell him not to add the quills ?\\n Thought he’d make you look good if he got it wrong , did you ?\\n That’s another point you’ve lost for Gryffindor . ”\\n This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue , but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron .\\n “ Don’t push it , ” he muttered , “ I’ve heard Snape can turn very nasty . ”\\n As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later , Harry’s mind was racing and his spirits were low .\\n He’d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week why did Snape hate him so much ?\\n “ Cheer up , ” said Ron , “ Snape’s always taking points off Fred and George .\\n Can I come and meet Hagrid with you ? ”\\n At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds .\\n Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest .\\n A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door .\\n When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks .\\n Then Hagrid ’ s voice rang out , saying , “ Back , Fang back . ”\\n Hagrid ’ s big , hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open .\\n “ Hang on , ” he said .\\n “ Back , Fang . ”\\n He let them in , struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound .\\n There was only one room inside .\\n Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling , a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire , and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it .\\n “ Make yerselves at home , ” said Hagrid , letting go of Fang , who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears .\\n Like Hagrid , Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked .\\n “ This is Ron , ” Harry told Hagrid , who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate .\\n “ Another Weasley , eh ? ”\\n said Hagrid , glancing at Ron’s freckles .\\n “ I spent half me life chasin ’ yer twin brothers away from the forest . ”\\n The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth , but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons .\\n Fang rested his head on Harry’s knee and drooled all over his robes .\\n Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch “ that old git . ”\\n “ An ’ as fer that cat , Mrs Norris , I’d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime .\\n D’yeh know , every time I go up ter the school , she follows me everywhere ?\\n Can’t get rid of her Filch puts her up to it . ”\\n Harry told Hagrid about Snape’s lesson .\\n Hagrid , like Ron , told Harry not to worry about it , that Snape liked hardly any of the students .\\n “ But he seemed to really hate me . ”\\n “ Rubbish ! ”\\n said Hagrid .\\n “ Why should he ? ”\\n Yet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite meet his eyes when he said that .\\n “ How’s yer brother Charlie ? ”\\n Hagrid asked Ron .\\n “ I liked him a lot great with animals . ”\\n Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose .\\n While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie’s work with dragons , Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy .\\n It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet : GRINGOTTS BREAK IN LATEST Investigations continue into the break in at Gringotts on 3 1 July , widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown .\\n Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken .\\n The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day .\\n “ But we’re not telling you what was in there , so keep your noses out if you know what’s good for you , ” said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon .\\n Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts , but Ron hadn’t mentioned the date .\\n “ Hagrid ! ”\\n said Harry , “ that Gringotts break in happened on my birthday !\\n It might’ve been happening while we were there ! ”\\n There was no doubt about it , Hagrid definitely didn’t meet Harry’s eyes this time .\\n He grunted and offered him another rock cake .\\n Harry read the story again .\\n The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day .\\n Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen , if you could call it emptying , taking out that grubby little package .\\n Had that been what the thieves were looking for ?\\n As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner , their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they’d been too polite to refuse , Harry thought that none of the lessons he’d had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid .\\n Had Hagrid collected that package just in time ?\\n Where was it now ?\\n And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn’t want to tell Harry ?',\n",
       "   'Chapter : THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR .\\n In years to come , Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment .\\n Yet the days crept by , and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door .\\n It was sweltering hot , especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers .\\n They had been given special , new quills for the exams , which had been bewitched with an Anti Cheating spell .\\n They had practical exams as well .\\n Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tap dance across a desk .\\n Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was , but taken away if it had whiskers .\\n Snape made them all nervous , breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion .\\n Harry did the best he could , trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead , which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest .\\n Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn’t sleep , but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare , except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it .\\n Maybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harry had seen in the forest , or because they didn’t have scars burning on their foreheads , but Ron and Hermione didn’t seem as worried about the Stone as Harry .\\n The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them , but he didn’t keep visiting them in dreams , and they were so busy with their studying they didn’t have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to .\\n Their very last exam was History of Magic .\\n One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who’d invented self stirring cauldrons and they’d be free , free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out .\\n When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment , Harry couldn’t help cheering with the rest .\\n “ That was far easier than I thought it would be , ” said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds .\\n “ I needn’t have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager . ”\\n Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward , but Ron said this made him feel ill , so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree .\\n The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid , which was basking in the warm shallows .\\n “ No more studying , ” Ron sighed happily , stretching out on the grass .\\n “ You could look more cheerful , Harry , we’ve got a week before we find out how badly we’ve done , there’s no need to worry yet . ”\\n Harry was rubbing his forehead .\\n “ I wish I knew what this means ” he burst out angrily .\\n “ My scar keeps hurting it’s happened before , but never as often as this . ”\\n “ Go to Madam Pomfrey , ” Hermione suggested .\\n “ I’m not ill , ” said Harry .\\n “ I think it’s a warning it means danger’s coming . ”\\n Ron couldn’t get worked up , it was too hot .\\n “ Harry , relax , Hermione ’ s right , the Stone’s safe as long as Dumbledore’s around .\\n Anyway , we’ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy .\\n He nearly had his leg ripped off once , he’s not going to try it again in a hurry .\\n And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down . ”\\n Harry nodded , but he couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he’d forgotten to do , something important .\\n When he tried to explain this , Hermione said , “ That’s just the exams .\\n I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we’d done that one . ”\\n Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have anything to do with work , though .\\n He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky , a note clamped in its mouth .\\n Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters .\\n Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore .\\n Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy never but Harry suddenly jumped to his feet .\\n “ Where ’ re you going ? ”\\n said Ron sleepily .\\n “ I’ve just thought of something , ” said Harry .\\n He had turned white .\\n “ We’ve got to go and see Hagrid , now . ”\\n “ Why ? ”\\n panted Hermione , hurrying to keep up .\\n “ Don’t you think it’s a bit odd , ” said Harry , scrambling up the grassy slope , “ that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon , and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket ?\\n How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it’s against wizard law ?\\n Lucky they found Hagrid , don’t you think ?\\n Why didn’t I see it before ? ”\\n “ What are you talking about ? ”\\n said Ron , but Harry , sprinting across the grounds toward the forest , didn’t answer .\\n Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house his trousers and sleeves were rolled up , and he was shelling peas into a large bowl .\\n “ Hullo , ” he said , smiling .\\n “ Finished yer exams ?\\n Got time fer a drink ? ”\\n “ Yes , please , ” said Ron , but Harry cut him off .\\n “ No , we’re in a hurry .\\n Hagrid , I’ve got to ask you something .\\n You know that night you won Norbert ?\\n What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like ? ”\\n “ Dunno said Hagrid casually , “ he wouldn ’ take his cloak off . ”\\n He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows .\\n “ It’s not that unusual , yeh get a lot o ’ funny folk in the Hog’s Head that’s one o ’ the pubs down in the village .\\n Mighta bin a dragon dealer , mightn ’ he ?\\n I never saw his face , he kept his hood up . ”\\n Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas .\\n “ What did you talk to him about , Hagrid ?\\n Did you mention Hogwarts at all ? ”\\n “ Mighta come up , ” said Hagrid , frowning as he tried to remember .\\n “ Yeah he asked what I did , an ’ I told him I was gamekeeper here .\\n He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I look after so I told him an ’ I said what I’d always really wanted was a dragon an ’ then I can ’ remember too well , ’ cause he kept buyin ’ me drinks .\\n Let’s see yeah , then he said he had the dragon egg an ’ we could play cards fer it if I wanted but he had ter be sure I could handle it , he didn ’ want it ter go ter any old home .\\n So I told him , after Fluffy , a dragon would be easy . ”\\n “ And did he did he seem interested in Fluffy ? ”\\n Harry asked , trying to keep his voice calm .\\n “ Well yeah how many three headed dogs d’yeh meet , even around Hogwarts ?\\n So I told him , Fluffy’s a piece o ’ cake if yeh know how to calm him down , jus ’ play him a bit o ’ music an ’ he’ll go straight off ter sleep ” Hagrid suddenly looked horrified .\\n “ I shouldn’ta told yeh that ! ”\\n he blurted out .\\n “ Forget I said it !\\n Hey where’re yeh goin ’ ? ”\\n Harry , Ron , and Hermione didn’t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall , which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds .\\n “ We’ve got to go to Dumbledore , ” said Harry .\\n “ Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy , and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak it must’ve been easy , once he’d got Hagrid drunk .\\n I just hope Dumbledore believes us .\\n Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn’t stop him .\\n Where’s Dumbledore’s office ? ”\\n They looked around , as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction .\\n They had never been told where Dumbledore lived , nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him .\\n “ Well just have to ” Harry began , but a voice suddenly rang across the hall .\\n “ What are you three doing inside ? ”\\n It was Professor McGonagall , carrying a large pile of books .\\n “ We want to see Professor Dumbledore , ” said Hermione , rather bravely , Harry and Ron thought .\\n “ See Professor Dumbledore ? ”\\n Professor McGonagall repeated , as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do .\\n “ Why ? ”\\n Harry swallowed now what ?\\n “ It’s sort of secret , ” he said , but he wished at once he hadn’t , because Professor McGonagall’s nostrils flared .\\n “ Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago , ” she said coldly .\\n “ He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once . ”\\n “ He’s gone ? ”\\n said Harry frantically .\\n “ Now ? ”\\n “ Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard , Potter , he has many demands on his time ” “ But this is important . ”\\n “ Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic , Potter ? ”\\n “ Look , ” said Harry , throwing caution to the winds , “ Professor it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone ” Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected , it wasn’t that .\\n The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms , but she didn’t pick them up .\\n “ How do you know ? ”\\n she spluttered .\\n “ Professor , I think I know that Sn that someone’s going to try and steal the Stone .\\n I’ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore . ”\\n She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion .\\n “ Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow , ” she said finally .\\n “ I don’t know how you found out about the Stone , but rest assured , no one can possibly steal it , it’s too well protected . ”\\n “ But Professor ” “ Potter , I know what I’m talking about , ” she said shortly .\\n She bent down and gathered up the fallen books .\\n “ I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine . ”\\n But they didn’t .\\n “ It’s tonight , ” said Harry , once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot .\\n “ Snape’s going through the trapdoor tonight .\\n He’s found out everything he needs , and now he’s got Dumbledore out of the way .\\n He sent that note , I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up . ”\\n “ But what can we ” Hermione gasped .\\n Harry and Ron wheeled round .\\n Snape was standing there .\\n “ Good afternoon , ” he said smoothly .\\n They stared at him .\\n “ You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this , ” he said , with an odd , twisted smile .\\n “ We were ” Harry began , without any idea what he was going to say .\\n “ You want to be more careful , ” said Snape .\\n “ Hanging around like this , people will think you’re up to something .\\n And Gryffindor really can’t afford to lose any more points , can it ? ”\\n Harry flushed .\\n They turned to go outside , but Snape called them back .\\n “ Be warned , Potter any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled .\\n Good day to you . ”\\n He strode off in the direction of the staffroom .\\n Out on the stone steps , Harry turned to the others .\\n “ Right , here’s what we’ve got to do , ” he whispered urgently .\\n “ One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape wait outside the staffroom and follow him if he leaves it .\\n Hermione , you’d better do that . ”\\n “ Why me ? ”\\n “ It’s obvious , ” said Ron .\\n “ You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick , you know . ”\\n He put on a high voice , “ ‘ Oh Professor Flitwick , I’m so worried , I think I got question fourteen b wrong . ’ ”\\n “ Oh , shut up , ” said Hermione , but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape .\\n “ And we’d better stay outside the third floor corridor , ” Harry told Ron .\\n “ Come on . ”\\n But that part of the plan didn’t work .\\n No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time , she lost her temper .\\n “ I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments ! ”\\n she stormed .\\n “ Enough of this nonsense !\\n If I hear you’ve come anywhere near here again , I’ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor !\\n Yes , Weasley , from my own House ! ”\\n Harry and Ron went back to the common room .\\n Harry had just said , “ At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail , ” when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in .\\n “ I’m sorry , Harry ! ”\\n she wailed .\\n “ Snape came out and asked me what I was doing , so I said I was waiting for Flitwick , and Snape went to get him , and I’ve only just got away , I don’t know where Snape went . ”\\n “ Well , that’s it then , isn’t it ? ”\\n Harry said .\\n The other two stared at him .\\n He was pale and his eyes were glittering .\\n “ I’m going out of here tonight and I’m going to try and get to the Stone first . ”\\n “ You’re mad ! ”\\n said Ron .\\n “ You can’t ! ”\\n said Hermione .\\n “ After what McGonagall and Snape have said ?\\n You’ll be expelled ! ”\\n “ SO WHAT ? ”\\n Harry shouted .\\n “ Don’t you understand ?\\n If Snape gets hold of the Stone , Voldemort’s coming back !\\n Haven’t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over ?\\n There won’t be any Hogwarts to get expelled from !\\n He’ll flatten it , or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts !\\n Losing points doesn’t matter anymore , can’t you see ?\\n D’you think he’ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the House Cup ?\\n If I get caught before I can get to the Stone , well , I’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there , it’s only dying a bit later than I would have , because I’m never going over to the Dark Side !\\n I’m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me !\\n Voldemort killed my parents , remember ? ”\\n He glared at them .\\n “ You’re right , Harry , ” said Hermione in a small voice .\\n “ I’ll use the Invisibility Cloak , ” said Harry .\\n “ It’s just lucky I got it back . ”\\n “ But will it cover all three of us ? ”\\n said Ron .\\n “ All all three of us ? ”\\n “ Oh , come off it , you don’t think we’d let you go alone ? ”\\n “ Of course not , ” said Hermione briskly .\\n “ How do you think you’d get to the Stone without us ?\\n I’d better go and look through my books , there might be something useful . ”\\n “ But if we get caught , you two will be expelled , too . ”\\n “ Not if I can help it , ” said Hermione grimly .\\n “ Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam .\\n They’re not throwing me out after that . ”\\n After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room .\\n Nobody bothered them none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more , after all .\\n This was the first night he hadn’t been upset by it .\\n Hermione was skimming through all her notes , hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break .\\n Harry and Ron didn’t talk much .\\n Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do .\\n Slowly , the room emptied as people drifted off to bed .\\n “ Better get the cloak , ” Ron muttered , as Lee Jordan finally left , stretching and yawning .\\n Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory .\\n He pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas .\\n He pocketed it to use on Fluffy he didn’t feel much like singing .\\n He ran back down to the common room .\\n “ We’d better put the cloak on here , and make sure it covers all three of us if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own ” “ What are you doing ? ”\\n said a voice from the corner of the room .\\n Neville appeared from behind an armchair , clutching Trevor the toad , who looked as though he’d been making another bid for freedom .\\n “ Nothing , Neville , nothing , ” said Harry , hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back .\\n Neville stared at their guilty faces .\\n “ You’re going out again , ” he said .\\n “ No , no , no , ” said Hermione .\\n “ No , we’re not .\\n Why don’t you go to bed , Neville ? ”\\n Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door .\\n They couldn’t afford to waste any more time , Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep .\\n “ You can’t go out , ” said Neville , “ you’ll be caught again .\\n Gryffindor will be in even more trouble . ”\\n “ You don’t understand , ” said Harry , “ this is important . ”\\n But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate .\\n “ I won’t let you do it , ” he said , hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole .\\n “ I’ll I’ll fight you ! ”\\n “ Neville , ” Ron exploded , “ get away from that hole and don’t be an idiot ” “ Don’t you call me an idiot ! ”\\n said Neville .\\n “ I don’t think you should be breaking any more rules !\\n And you were the one who told me to stand up to people ! ”\\n “ Yes , but not to us , ” said Ron in exasperation .\\n “ Neville , you don’t know what you’re doing . ”\\n He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad , who leapt out of sight .\\n “ Go on then , try and hit me ! ”\\n said Neville , raising his fists .\\n “ I’m ready ! ”\\n Harry turned to Hermione .\\n “ Do something , ” he said desperately .\\n Hermione stepped forward .\\n “ Neville , ” she said , “ I’m really , really sorry about this . ”\\n She raised her wand .\\n “ Petrificus Totalusl ” she cried , pointing it at Neville .\\n Neville’s arms snapped to his sides .\\n His legs sprang together .\\n His whole body rigid , he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face , stiff as a board .\\n Hermione ran to turn him over .\\n Neville’s jaws were jammed together so he couldn’t speak .\\n Only his eyes were moving , looking at them in horror .\\n “ What’ve you done to him ? ”\\n Harry whispered .\\n “ It’s the full Body Bind , ” said Hermione miserably .\\n “ Oh , Neville , I’m so sorry . ”\\n “ We had to , Neville , no time to explain , ” said Harry .\\n “ You’ll understand later , Neville , ” said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak .\\n But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn’t feel like a very good omen .\\n In their nervous state , every statue’s shadow looked like Filch , every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them .\\n At the foot of the first set of stairs , they spotted Mrs Norris skulking near the top .\\n “ Oh , let’s kick her , just this once , ” Ron whispered in Harry’s ear , but Harry shook his head .\\n As they climbed carefully around her , Mrs Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them , but didn’t do anything .\\n They didn’t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor .\\n Peeves was bobbing halfway up , loosening the carpet so that people would trip .\\n “ Who’s there ? ”\\n he said suddenly as they climbed toward him .\\n He narrowed his wicked black eyes .\\n “ Know you’re there , even if I can’t see you .\\n Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie ? ”\\n He rose up in the air and floated there , squinting at them .\\n “ Should call Filch , I should , if something’s a creeping around unseen . ”\\n Harry had a sudden idea .\\n “ Peeves , ” he said , in a hoarse whisper , “ the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible . ”\\n Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock .\\n He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs .\\n “ So sorry , your bloodiness , Mr Baron , sir , ” he said greasily .\\n “ My mistake , my mistake I didn’t see you of course I didn’t , you’re invisible forgive old Peevsie his little joke , sir . ”\\n “ I have business here , Peeves , ” croaked Harry .\\n “ Stay away from this place tonight . ”\\n “ I will , sir , I most certainly will , ” said Peeves , rising up in the air again .\\n “ Hope your business goes well , Baron , I’ll not bother you . ”\\n And he scooted off .\\n “ Brilliant , Harry ! ”\\n whispered Ron .\\n A few seconds later , they were there , outside the third floor corridor and the door was already ajar .\\n “ Well , there you are , ” Harry said quietly , “ Snape’s already got past Fluffy . ”\\n Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them .\\n Underneath the cloak , Harry turned to the other two .\\n “ If you want to go back , I won’t blame you , ” he said .\\n “ You can take the cloak , I won’t need it now . ”\\n “ Don’t be stupid , ” said Ron .\\n “ We’re coming , ” said Hermione .\\n Harry pushed the door open .\\n As the door creaked , low , rumbling growls met their ears .\\n All three of the dog’s noses sniffed madly in their direction , even though it couldn’t see them .\\n “ What’s that at its feet ? ”\\n Hermione whispered .\\n “ Looks like a harp , ” said Ron .\\n “ Snape must have left it there . ”\\n “ It must wake up the moment you stop playing , ” said Harry .\\n “ Well , here goes ” He put Hagrid’s flute to his lips and blew .\\n It wasn’t really a tune , but from the first note the beast’s eyes began to droop .\\n Harry hardly drew breath .\\n Slowly , the dog’s growls ceased it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees , then it slumped to the ground , fast asleep .\\n “ Keep playing , ” Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor .\\n They could feel the dog’s hot , smelly breath as they approached the giant heads .\\n “ I think we’ll be able to pull the door open , ” said Ron , peering over the dog’s back .\\n “ Want to go first , Hermione ? ”\\n “ No , I don’t ! ”\\n “ All right . ”\\n Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog’s legs .\\n He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor , which swung up and open .\\n “ What can you see ? ”\\n Hermione said anxiously .\\n “ Nothing just black there’s no way of climbing down , we’ll just have to drop . ”\\n Harry , who was still playing the flute , waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself .\\n “ You want to go first ?\\n Are you sure ? ”\\n said Ron .\\n “ I don’t know how deep this thing goes .\\n Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep . ”\\n Harry handed the flute over .\\n In the few seconds ’ silence , the dog growled and twitched , but the moment Hermione began to play , it fell back into its deep sleep .\\n Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor .\\n There was no sign of the bottom .\\n He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips .\\n Then he looked up at Ron and said , “ If anything happens to me , don’t follow .\\n Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore , right ? ”\\n “ Right , ” said Ron .\\n “ See you in a minute , I hope . ”\\n And Harry let go .\\n Cold , damp air rushed past him as he fell down , down , down and FLUMP .\\n With a funny , muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft .\\n He sat up and felt around , his eyes not used to the gloom .\\n It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant .\\n “ It’s okay ! ”\\n he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp , which was the open trapdoor , “ it’s a soft landing , you can jump ! ”\\n Ron followed right away .\\n He landed , sprawled next to Harry .\\n “ What’s this stuff ? ”\\n were his first words .\\n “ Dunno , some sort of plant thing .\\n I suppose it’s here to break the fall .\\n Come on , Hermione ! ”\\n The distant music stopped .\\n There was a loud bark from the dog , but Hermione had already jumped .\\n She landed on Harry’s other side .\\n “ We must be miles under the school , ” she said .\\n “ Lucky this plant thing’s here , really , ” said Ron .\\n “ Lucky ” shrieked Hermione .\\n “ Look at you both ! ”\\n She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall .\\n She had to struggle because the moment she had landed , the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles .\\n As for Harry and Ron , their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing .\\n Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her .\\n Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them , but the more they strained against it , the tighter and faster the plant wound around them .\\n “ Stop moving ! ”\\n Hermione ordered them .\\n “ I know what this is it’s Devil’s Snare ! ”\\n “ Oh , I’m so glad we know what it’s called , that’s a great help , ” snarled Ron , leaning back , trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck .\\n “ Shut up , I’m trying to remember how to kill it ! ”\\n said Hermione .\\n “ Well , hurry up , I can’t breathe ! ”\\n Harry gasped , wrestling with it as it curled around his chest .\\n “ Devil’s Snare , Devil’s Snare what did Professor Sprout say ?\\n it likes the dark and the damp ” “ So light a fire ! ”\\n Harry choked .\\n “ Yes of course but there’s no wood ! ”\\n Hermione cried , wringing her hands .\\n “ HAVE YOU GONE MAD ? ”\\n Ron bellowed .\\n “ ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT ? ”\\n “ Oh , right ! ”\\n said Hermione , and she whipped out her wand , waved it , muttered something , and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant .\\n In a matter of seconds , the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth .\\n Wriggling and flailing , it unraveled itself from their bodies , and they were able to pull free .\\n “ Lucky you pay attention in Herbology , Hermione , ” said Harry as he joined her by the wall , wiping sweat off his face .\\n “ Yeah , ” said Ron , “ and lucky Harry doesn’t lose his head in a crisis ‘ there’s no wood , ’ honestly . ”\\n “ This way , ” said Harry , pointing down a stone passageway , which was the only way forward .\\n All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls .\\n The passageway sloped downward , and Harry was reminded of Gringotts .\\n With an unpleasant jolt of the heart , he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards ’ bank .\\n If they met a dragon , a fully grown dragon Norbert had been bad enough “ Can you hear something ? ”\\n Ron whispered .\\n Harry listened .\\n A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead .\\n “ Do you think it’s a ghost ? ”\\n “ I don’t know sounds like wings to me . ”\\n “ There’s light ahead I can see something moving . ”\\n They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber , its ceiling arching high above them .\\n It was full of small , jewel bright birds , fluttering and tumbling all around the room .\\n On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door .\\n “ Do you think they’ll attack us if we cross the room ? ”\\n said Ron .\\n “ Probably , ” said Harry .\\n “ They don’t look very vicious , but I suppose if they all swooped down at once well , there’s no other choice I’ll run . ”\\n He took a deep breath , covered his face with his arms , and sprinted across the room .\\n He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second , but nothing happened .\\n He reached the door untouched .\\n He pulled the handle , but it was locked .\\n The other two followed him .\\n They tugged and heaved at the door , but it wouldn’t budge , not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora Charm .\\n “ Now what ? ”\\n said Ron .\\n “ These birds they can’t be here just for decoration , ” said Hermione .\\n They watched the birds soaring overhead , glittering glittering ?\\n “ They’re not birds ! ”\\n Harry said suddenly .\\n “ They’re keys Winged keys look carefully .\\n So that must mean ” he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys . “\\n yes look !\\n Broomsticks !\\n We’ve got to catch the key to the door ! ”\\n “ But there are hundreds of them ! ”\\n Ron examined the lock on the door .\\n “ We’re looking for a big , old fashioned one probably silver , like the handle . ”\\n They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air , soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys .\\n They grabbed and snatched , but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one .\\n Not for nothing , though , was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century .\\n He had a knack for spotting things other people didn’t .\\n After a minute’s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers , he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing , as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole .\\n “ That one ! ”\\n he called to the others .\\n “ That big one there no , there with bright blue wings the feathers are all crumpled on one side . ”\\n Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing , crashed into the ceiling , and nearly fell off his broom .\\n “ We’ve got to close in on it ! ”\\n Harry called , not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing .\\n “ Ron , you come at it from above Hermione , stay below and stop it from going down and I’ll try and catch it .\\n Right , NOW ! ”\\n Ron dived , Hermione rocketed upward , the key dodged them both , and Harry streaked after it it sped toward the wall , Harry leaned forward and with a nasty , crunching noise , pinned it against the stone with one hand .\\n Ron and Hermione ’ s cheers echoed around the high chamber .\\n They landed quickly , and Harry ran to the door , the key struggling in his hand .\\n He rammed it into the lock and turned it worked .\\n The moment the lock had clicked open , the key took flight again , looking very battered now that it had been caught twice .\\n “ Ready ? ”\\n Harry asked the other two , his hand on the door handle .\\n They nodded .\\n He pulled the door open .\\n The next chamber was so dark they couldn’t see anything at all .\\n But as they stepped into it , light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight .\\n They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard , behind the black chessmen , which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone .\\n Facing them , way across the chamber , were the white pieces .\\n Harry , Ron and Hermione shivered slightly the towering white chessmen had no faces .\\n “ Now what do we do ? ”\\n Harry whispered .\\n “ It’s obvious , isn’t it ? ”\\n said Ron .\\n “ We’ve got to play our way across the room . ”\\n Behind the white pieces they could see another door .\\n “ How ? ”\\n said Hermione nervously .\\n “ I think , ” said Ron , “ we’re going to have to be chessmen . ”\\n He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knights horse .\\n At once , the stone sprang to life .\\n The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron .\\n “ Do we er have to join you to get across ? ”\\n The black knight nodded .\\n Ron turned to the other two .\\n “ This needs thinking about . ”\\n he said .\\n “ I suppose we’ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces .\\n Harry and Hermione stayed quiet , watching Ron think .\\n Finally he said , “ Now , don’t be offended or anything , but neither of you are that good at chess “ We’re not offended , ” said Harry quickly .\\n “ Just tell us what to do . ”\\n “ Well , Harry , you take the place of that bishop , and Hermione , you go there instead of that castle . ”\\n “ What about you ? ”\\n “ I’m going to be a knight , ” said Ron .\\n The chessmen seemed to have been listening , because at these words a knight , a bishop , and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board , leaving three empty squares that Harry , Ron , and Hermione took .\\n “ White always plays first in chess , ” said Ron , peering across the board .\\n “ Yes look ” A white pawn had moved forward two squares .\\n Ron started to direct the black pieces .\\n They moved silently wherever he sent them .\\n Harry’s knees were trembling .\\n What if they lost ?\\n “ Harry move diagonally four squares to the right . ”\\n Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken .\\n The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board , where he lay quite still , facedown .\\n “ Had to let that happen , ” said Ron , looking shaken .\\n “ Leaves you free to take that bishop , Hermione , go on . ”\\n Every time one of their men was lost , the white pieces showed no mercy .\\n Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall .\\n Twice , Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger .\\n He himself darted around the board , taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones .\\n “ We’re nearly there , ” he muttered suddenly .\\n “ Let me think let me think ” The white queen turned her blank face toward him .\\n “ Yes ” said Ron softly , “ it’s the only way I’ve got to be taken . ”\\n “ NO ! ”\\n Harry and Hermione shouted .\\n “ That’s chess ! ”\\n snapped Ron .\\n “ You’ve got to make some sacrifices !\\n I make my move and she’ll take me that leaves you free to checkmate the king , Harry ! ”\\n “ But ” “ Do you want to stop Snape or not ? ”\\n “ Ron ” “ Look , if you don’t hurry up , hell already have the Stone ! ”\\n There was no alternative .\\n “ Ready ? ”\\n Ron called , his face pale but determined .\\n “ Here I go now , don’t hang around once you’ve won . ”\\n He stepped forward , and the white queen pounced .\\n She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm , and he crashed to the floor Hermione screamed but stayed on her square the white queen dragged Ron to one side .\\n He looked as if he’d been knocked out .\\n Shaking , Harry moved three spaces to the left .\\n The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry’s feet .\\n They had won .\\n The chessmen parted and bowed , leaving the door ahead clear .\\n With one last desperate look back at Ron , Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway .\\n “ What if he’s ? ”\\n “ He’ll be all right , ” said Harry , trying to convince himself .\\n “ What do you reckon’s next ? ”\\n “ We’ve had Sprout’s , that was the Devil’s Snare Flitwick must’ve put charms on the keys McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive that leaves Quirrell’s spell , and Snape’s ” They had reached another door .\\n “ All right ? ”\\n Harry whispered .\\n “ Go on . ”\\n Harry pushed it open .\\n A disgusting smell filled their nostrils , making both of them pull their robes up over their noses .\\n Eyes watering , they saw , flat on the floor in front of them , a troll even larger than the one they had tackled , out cold with a bloody lump on its head .\\n “ I’m glad we didn’t have to fight that one , ” Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs .\\n “ Come on , I can’t breathe . ”\\n He pulled open the next door , both of them hardly daring to look at what came next but there was nothing very frightening in here , just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line .\\n “ Snape’s , ” said Harry .\\n “ What do we have to do ? ”\\n They stepped over the threshold , and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway .\\n It wasn’t ordinary fire either it was purple .\\n At the same instant , black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward .\\n They were trapped .\\n “ Look ! ”\\n Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles .\\n Harry looked over her shoulder to read it : Danger lies before you , while safety lies behind , Two of us will help you , whichever you would find , One among us seven will let you move ahead , Another will transport the drinker back instead , Two among our number hold only nettle wine , Three of us are killers , waiting hidden in line .\\n Choose , unless you wish to stay here forevermore , To help you in your choice , we give you these clues four : First , however slyly the poison tries to hide You will always find some on nettle wine’s left side Second , different are those who stand at either end , But if you would move onward , neither is your friend Third , as you see clearly , all are different size , Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides Fourth , the second left and the second on the right Are twins once you taste them , though different at first sight Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry , amazed , saw that she was smiling , the very last thing he felt like doing .\\n “ Brilliant , ” said Hermione .\\n “ This isn’t magic it’s logic a puzzle .\\n A lot of the greatest wizards haven’t got an ounce of logic , they’d be stuck in here forever . ”\\n “ But so will we , won’t we ? ”\\n “ Of course not , ” said Hermione .\\n “ Everything we need is here on this paper .\\n Seven bottles : three are poison two are wine one will get us safely through the black fire , and one will get us back through the purple . ”\\n “ But how do we know which to drink ? ”\\n “ Give me a minute . ”\\n Hermione read the paper several times .\\n Then she walked up and down the line of bottles , muttering to herself and pointing at them .\\n At last , she clapped her hands .\\n “ Got it , ” she said .\\n “ The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire toward the Stone . ”\\n Harry looked at the tiny bottle .\\n “ There’s only enough there for one of us , ” he said .\\n “ That’s hardly one swallow . ”\\n They looked at each other .\\n “ Which one will get you back through the purple flames ? ”\\n Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line .\\n “ You drink that , ” said Harry .\\n “ No , listen , get back and get Ron .\\n Grab brooms from the flying key room , they’ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore , we need him .\\n I might be able to hold Snape off for a while , but I’m no match for him , really . ”\\n “ But Harry what if You Know Who’s with him ? ”\\n “ Well I was lucky once , wasn’t I ? ”\\n said Harry , pointing at his scar .\\n “ I might get lucky again . ”\\n Hermione’s lip trembled , and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him .\\n “ Hermionel ” “ Harry you’re a great wizard , you know . ”\\n “ I’m not as good as you , ” said Harry , very embarrassed , as she let go of him .\\n “ Me ! ”\\n said Hermione .\\n “ Books !\\n And cleverness !\\n There are more important things friendship and bravery and oh Harry be carefull ” “ You drink first , ” said Harry .\\n “ You are sure which is which , aren’t you ? ”\\n “ Positive , ” said Hermione .\\n She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end , and shuddered .\\n “ It’s not poison ? ”\\n said Harry anxiously .\\n “ No but it’s like ice . ”\\n “ Quick , go , before it wears off . ”\\n “ Good luck take care ” “ GO ! ”\\n Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire .\\n Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle .\\n He turned to face the black flames .\\n “ Here I come , ” he said , and he drained the little bottle in one gulp .\\n It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body .\\n He put the bottle down and walked forward he braced himself , saw the black flames licking his body , but couldn’t feel them for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire then he was on the other side , in the last chamber .\\n There was already someone there but it wasn’t Snape .\\n It wasn’t even Voldemort .',\n",
       "   'Chapter : NORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK .\\n Quirrell , however , must have been braver than they’d thought .\\n In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner , but it didn’t look as though he’d cracked yet .\\n Every time they passed the third floor corridor , Harry , Ron , and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside .\\n Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper , which surely meant that the Stone was still safe .\\n Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile , and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell’s stutter .\\n Hermione , however , had more on her mind than the Sorcerer’s Stone .\\n She had started drawing up study schedules and color coding all her notes .\\n Harry and Ron wouldn’t have minded , but she kept nagging them to do the same .\\n “ Hermione , the exams are ages away . ”\\n “ Ten weeks , ” Hermione snapped .\\n “ That’s not ages , that’s like a second to Nicolas Flamel . ”\\n “ But we’re not six hundred years old , ” Ron reminded her .\\n “ Anyway , what are you studying for , you already know it all . ”\\n “ What am I studying for ?\\n Are you crazy ?\\n You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year ?\\n They’re very important , I should have started studying a month ago , I don’t know what’s gotten into me . ”\\n Unfortunately , the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione .\\n They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays weren’t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones .\\n It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon’s blood or practicing wand movements .\\n Moaning and yawning , Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library with her , trying to get through all their extra work .\\n “ I’ll never remember this , ” Ron burst out one afternoon , throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window .\\n It was the first really fine day they’d had in months .\\n The sky was a clear , forget me not blue , and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming .\\n Harry , who was looking up “ Dittany ” in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi , didn’t look up until he heard Ron say , “ Hagrid !\\n What are you doing in the library ? ”\\n Hagrid shuffled into view , hiding something behind his back .\\n He looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat .\\n “ Jus ’ lookin ’ , ” he said , in a shifty voice that got their interest at once .\\n “ An ’ what’re you lot up ter ? ”\\n He looked suddenly suspicious .\\n “ Yer not still lookin ’ fer Nicolas Flamel , are yeh ? ”\\n “ Oh , we found out who he is ages ago , ” said Ron impressively .\\n “ And we know what that dog’s guarding , it’s a Sorcerer’s St ” “ Shhhh ” Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening .\\n “ Don ’ go shoutin ’ about it , what’s the matter with yeh ? ”\\n “ There are a few things we wanted to ask you , as a matter of fact , ” said Harry , “ about what’s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy ” “ SHHHH ! ”\\n said Hagrid again .\\n “ Listen come an ’ see me later , I’m not promisin ’ I’ll tell yeh anythin ’ , mind , but don ’ go rabbitin ’ about it in here , students aren ’ s’pposed ter know .\\n They’ll think I’ve told yeh ” “ See you later , then , ” said Harry .\\n Hagrid shuffled off .\\n “ What was he hiding behind his back ? ”\\n said Hermione thoughtfully .\\n “ Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone ? ”\\n “ I’m going to see what section he was in , ” said Ron , who’d had enough of working .\\n He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table .\\n “ Dragons ’ . ”\\n he whispered .\\n “ Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons !\\n Look at these : Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland From Egg to Inferno , A Dragon Keeper’s Guide . ”\\n “ Hagrid ’ s always wanted a dragon , he told me so the first time I ever met him , ” said Harry .\\n “ But it’s against our laws , ” said Ron .\\n “ Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks ’ Convention of 1709 , everyone knows that .\\n It’s hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we’re keeping dragons in the back garden anyway , you can’t tame dragons , it’s dangerous .\\n You should see the burns Charlie’s got off wild ones in Romania . ”\\n “ But there aren’t wild dragons in Britain ? ”\\n said Harry .\\n “ Of course there are , ” said Ron .\\n “ Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks .\\n The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up , I can tell you .\\n Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who’ve spotted them , to make them forget . ”\\n “ So what on earth’s Hagrid up to ? ”\\n said Hermione .\\n When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper’s hut an hour later , they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed .\\n Hagrid called “ Who is it ? ”\\n before he let them in , and then shut the door quickly behind them .\\n It was stifling hot inside .\\n Even though it was such a warm day , there was a blazing fire in the grate .\\n Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches , which they refused .\\n “ So yeh wanted to ask me somethin ’ ? ”\\n “ Yes , ” said Harry .\\n There was no point beating around the bush .\\n “ We were wondering if you could tell us what’s guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from Fluffy . ”\\n Hagrid frowned at him .\\n “ O ’ course I can’t , ” he said .\\n “ Number one , I don ’ know meself .\\n Number two , yeh know too much already , so I wouldn ’ tell yeh if I could .\\n That Stone’s here fer a good reason .\\n It was almost stolen outta Gringotts I s’ppose yeh’ve worked that out an ’ all ?\\n Beats me how yeh even know abou ’ Fluffy . ”\\n “ Oh , come on , Hagrid , you might not want to tell us , but you do know , you know everything that goes on round here , ” said Hermione in a warm , flattering voice .\\n Hagrid ’ s beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling .\\n “ We only wondered who had done the guarding , really . ”\\n Hermione went on .\\n “ We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him , apart from you . ”\\n Hagrid ’ s chest swelled at these last words .\\n Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione .\\n “ Well , I don ’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that let’s see he borrowed Fluffy from me then some o ’ the teachers did enchantments Professor Sprout Professor Flitwick Professor McGonagall ” he ticked them off on his fingers , “ Professor Quirrell an ’ Dumbledore himself did somethin ’ , o ’ course .\\n Hang on , I’ve forgotten someone .\\n Oh yeah , Professor Snape . ”\\n “ Snape ? ”\\n “ Yeah yer not still on abou ’ that , are yeh ?\\n Look , Snape helped protect the Stone , he’s not about ter steal it . ”\\n Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was .\\n If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone , it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it .\\n He probably knew everything except , it seemed , Quirrell’s spell and how to get past Fluffy .\\n “ You’re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy , aren’t you , Hagrid ? ”\\n said Harry anxiously .\\n “ And you wouldn’t tell anyone , would you ?\\n Not even one of the teachers ? ”\\n “ Not a soul knows except me an ’ Dumbledore , ” said Hagrid proudly .\\n “ Well , that’s something , ” Harry muttered to the others .\\n “ Hagrid , can we have a window open ?\\n I’m boiling . ”\\n “ Can’t , Harry , sorry , ” said Hagrid .\\n Harry noticed him glance at the fire .\\n Harry looked at it , too .\\n “ Hagrid what’s that ? ”\\n But he already knew what it was .\\n In the very heart of the fire , underneath the kettle , was a huge , black egg .\\n “ Ah , ” said Hagrid , fiddling nervously with his beard , “ That’s er ” “ Where did you get it , Hagrid ? ”\\n said Ron , crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg .\\n “ It must’ve cost you a fortune . ”\\n “ Won it , ” said Hagrid .\\n “ Las ’ night .\\n I was down in the village havin ’ a few drinks an ’ got into a game o ’ cards with a stranger .\\n Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it , ter be honest . ”\\n “ But what are you going to do with it when it’s hatched ? ”\\n said Hermione .\\n “ Well , I’ve bin doin ’ some readin ’ , ” said Hagrid , pulling a large book from under his pillow .\\n “ Got this outta the library Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit it’s a bit outta date , o ’ course , but it’s all in here .\\n Keep the egg in the fire , ’ cause their mothers breathe on ’ em , see , an ’ when it hatches , feed it on a bucket o ’ brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour .\\n An ’ see here how ter recognize diff’rent eggs what I got there’s a Norwegian Ridge back .\\n They’re rare , them . ”\\n He looked very pleased with himself , but Hermione didn’t .\\n “ Hagrid , you live in a wooden house , ” she said .\\n But Hagrid wasn’t listening .\\n He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire .\\n So now they had something else to worry about : what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut .\\n “ Wonder what it’s like to have a peaceful life , ” Ron sighed , as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting .\\n Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron , too .\\n It was driving them nuts .\\n Then , one breakfast time , Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid .\\n He had written only two words : It’s hatching .\\n Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut .\\n Hermione wouldn’t hear of it .\\n “ Hermione , how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching ? ”\\n “ We’ve got lessons , we’ll get into trouble , and that’s nothing to what Hagrid ’ s going to be in when someone finds out what he’s doing ” “ Shut up ! ”\\n Harry whispered .\\n Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen .\\n How much had he heard ?\\n Harry didn’t like the look on Malfoy’s face at all .\\n Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end , Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid’s with the other two during morning break .\\n When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson , the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest .\\n Hagrid greeted them , looking flushed and excited .\\n “ It’s nearly out . ”\\n He ushered them inside .\\n The egg was lying on the table .\\n There were deep cracks in it .\\n Something was moving inside a funny clicking noise was coming from it .\\n They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath .\\n All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open .\\n The baby dragon flopped onto the table .\\n It wasn’t exactly pretty Harry thought it looked like a crumpled , black umbrella .\\n Its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body , it had a long snout with wide nostrils , the stubs of horns and bulging , orange eyes .\\n It sneezed .\\n A couple of sparks flew out of its snout .\\n “ Isn’t he beautiful ? ”\\n Hagrid murmured .\\n He reached out a hand to stroke the dragon’s head .\\n It snapped at his fingers , showing pointed fangs .\\n “ Bless him , look , he knows his mommy ! ”\\n said Hagrid .\\n “ Hagrid , ” said Hermione , “ how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow , exactly ? ”\\n Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face he leapt to his feet and ran to the window .\\n “ What’s the matter ? ”\\n “ Someone was lookin ’ through the gap in the curtains it’s a kid he’s runnin ’ back up ter the school . ”\\n Harry bolted to the door and looked out .\\n Even at a distance there was no mistaking him .\\n Malfoy had seen the dragon .\\n Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face during the next week made Harry , Ron , and Hermione very nervous .\\n They spent most of their free time in Hagrid ’ s darkened hut , trying to reason with him .\\n “ Just let him go , ” Harry urged .\\n “ Set him free . ”\\n “ I can’t , ” said Hagrid .\\n “ He’s too little .\\n He’d die . ”\\n They looked at the dragon .\\n It had grown three times in length in just a week .\\n Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils .\\n Hagrid hadn’t been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy .\\n There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor .\\n “ I’ve decided to call him Norbert , ” said Hagrid , looking at the dragon with misty eyes .\\n “ He really knows me now , watch .\\n Norbert !\\n Norbert !\\n Where’s Mommy ? ”\\n “ He’s lost his marbles , ” Ron muttered in Harry’s ear .\\n “ Hagrid , ” said Harry loudly , “ give it two weeks and Norbert’s going to be as long as your house .\\n Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment . ”\\n Hagrid bit his lip .\\n “ I I know I can’t keep him forever , but I can’t jus ’ dump him , can’t . ”\\n Harry suddenly turned to Ron .\\n “ Charlie , ” he said .\\n “ You’re losing it , too , ” said Ron .\\n “ I’m Ron , remember ? ”\\n “ No Charlie your brother , Charlie .\\n In Romania .\\n Studying dragons .\\n We could send Norbert to him .\\n Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild ! ”\\n “ Brilliant ! ”\\n said Ron .\\n “ How about it , Hagrid ? ”\\n And in the end , Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to Charlie to ask him .\\n The following week dragged by .\\n Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room , long after everyone else had gone to bed .\\n The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open .\\n Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry’s Invisibility Cloak .\\n He had been down at Hagrid’s hut , helping him feed Norbert , who was now eating dead rats by the crate .\\n “ It bit me ! ”\\n he said , showing them his hand , which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief .\\n “ I’m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week .\\n I tell you , that dragon’s the most horrible animal I’ve ever met , but the way Hagrid goes on about it , you’d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit .\\n When it bit me he told me off for frightening it .\\n And when I left , he was singing it a lullaby . ”\\n There was a tap on the dark window .\\n “ It’s Hedwig ! ”\\n said Harry , hurrying to let her in .\\n “ She’ll have Charlie’s answer ! ”\\n The three of them put their heads together to read the note .\\n Dear Ron , How are you ?\\n Thanks for the letter I’d be glad to take the Norwegian Ridgeback , but it won’t be easy getting him here .\\n I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week .\\n Trouble is , they mustn’t be seen carrying an illegal dragon .\\n Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday ?\\n They can meet you there and take him away while it’s still dark .\\n Send me an answer as soon as possible .\\n Love , Charlie They looked at one another .\\n “ We’ve got the Invisibility Cloak , ” said Harry .\\n “ It shouldn’t be too difficult I think the cloak’s big enough to cover two of us and Norbert . ”\\n It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him .\\n Anything to get rid of Norbert and Malfoy .\\n There was a hitch .\\n By the next morning , Ron’s bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size .\\n He didn’t know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey would she recognize a dragon bite ?\\n By the afternoon , though , he had no choice .\\n The cut had turned a nasty shade of green .\\n It looked as if Norbert’s fangs were poisonous .\\n Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed .\\n “ It’s not just my hand , ” he whispered , “ although that feels like it’s about to fall off .\\n Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me .\\n He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me I’ve told her it was a dog , but I don’t think she believes me I shouldn’t have hit him at the Quidditch match , that’s why he’s doing this . ”\\n Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down .\\n “ It’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday , ” said Hermione , but this didn’t soothe Ron at all .\\n On the contrary , he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat .\\n “ Midnight on Saturday ! ”\\n he said in a hoarse voice .\\n “ Oh no oh no I’ve just remembered Charlie’s letter was in that book Malfoy took , he’s going to know we’re getting rid of Norbert . ”\\n Harry and Hermione didn’t get a chance to answer .\\n Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave , saying Ron needed sleep .\\n “ It’s too late to change the plan now , ” Harry told Hermione .\\n “ We haven’t got time to send Charlie another owl , and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert .\\n We’ll have to risk it .\\n And we have got the Invisibility Cloak , Malfoy doesn’t know about that . ”\\n They found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid , who opened a window to talk to them .\\n “ I won’t let you in , ” he puffed .\\n “ Norbert’s at a tricky stage nothin ’ I can’t handle . ”\\n When they told him about Charlie’s letter , his eyes filled with tears , although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg .\\n “ Aargh !\\n It’s all right , he only got my boot jus ’ playin ’ he’s only a baby , after all . ”\\n The baby banged its tail on the wall , making the windows rattle .\\n Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn’t come quickly enough .\\n They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good bye to Norbert if they hadn’t been so worried about what they had to do .\\n It was a very dark , cloudy night , and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrid ’ s hut because they’d had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall , where he’d been playing tennis against the wall .\\n Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate .\\n “ He’s got lots o ’ rats an ’ some brandy fer the journey , ” said Hagrid in a muffled voice .\\n “ An ’ I’ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely . ”\\n From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off .\\n “ Bye bye , Norbert ! ”\\n Hagrid sobbed , as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath it themselves .\\n “ Mommy will never forget you ! ”\\n How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle , they never knew .\\n Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors .\\n Up another staircase , then another even one of Harry’s shortcuts didn’t make the work much easier .\\n “ Nearly there ! ”\\n Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower .\\n Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate .\\n Forgetting that they were already invisible , they shrank into the shadows , staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away .\\n A lamp flared .\\n Professor McGonagall , in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net , had Malfoy by the ear .\\n “ Detention ! ”\\n she shouted .\\n “ And twenty points from Slytherin !\\n Wandering around in the middle of the night , how dare you ” “ You don’t understand , Professor .\\n Harry Potter’s coming he’s got a dragon ! ”\\n “ What utter rubbish !\\n How dare you tell such lies !\\n Come on I shall see Professor Snape about you , Malfoy ! ”\\n The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that .\\n Not until they’d stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak , glad to be able to breathe properly again .\\n Hermione did a sort of jig .\\n “ Malfoy’s got detention !\\n I could sing ! ”\\n “ Don’t , ” Harry advised her .\\n Chuckling about Malfoy , they waited , Norbert thrashing about in his crate .\\n About ten minutes later , four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness .\\n Charlie’s friends were a cheery lot .\\n They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they’d rigged up , so they could suspend Norbert between them .\\n They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much .\\n At last , Norbert was going going gone .\\n They slipped back down the spiral staircase , their hearts as light as their hands , now that Norbert was off them .\\n No more dragon Malfoy in detention what could spoil their happiness ?\\n The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs .\\n As they stepped into the corridor , Filch’s face loomed suddenly out of the darkness .\\n “ Well , well , well , ” he whispered , “ we are in trouble . ”\\n They’d left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower .',\n",
       "   'Chapter : THE FORBIDDEN FOREST .\\n Things couldn’t have been worse .\\n Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall’s study on the first floor , where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other .\\n Hermione was trembling .\\n Excuses , alibis , and wild cover up stories chased each other around Harry’s brain , each more feeble than the last .\\n He couldn’t see how they were going to get out of trouble this time .\\n They were cornered .\\n How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak ?\\n There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night , let alone being up the tallest Astronomy Tower , which was out of bounds except for classes .\\n Add Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak , and they might as well be packing their bags already .\\n Had Harry thought that things couldn’t have been worse ?\\n He was wrong .\\n When Professor McGonagall appeared , she was leading Neville .\\n “ Harry ! ”\\n Neville burst out , the moment he saw the other two .\\n “ I was trying to find you to warn you , I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you , he said you had a drag ” Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up , but Professor McGonagall had seen .\\n She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them .\\n “ I would never have believed it of any of you .\\n Mr Filch says you were up in the Astronomy Tower .\\n It’s one o’clock in the morning .\\n Explain yourselves . ”\\n It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher’s question .\\n She was staring at her slippers , as still as a statue .\\n “ I think I’ve got a good idea of what’s been going on , ” said Professor McGonagall .\\n “ It doesn’t take a genius to work it out .\\n You fed Draco Malfoy some cock and bull story about a dragon , trying to get him out of bed and into trouble .\\n I’ve already caught him .\\n I suppose you think it’s funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it , too ? ”\\n Harry caught Neville’s eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn’t true , because Neville was looking stunned and hurt .\\n Poor , blundering Neville Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark , to warn them .\\n “ I’m disgusted , ” said Professor McGonagall .\\n “ Four students out of bed in one night !\\n I’ve never heard of such a thing before !\\n You , Miss Granger , I thought you had more sense .\\n As for you , Mr Potter , I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this .\\n All three of you will receive detentions yes , you too , Mr Longbottom , nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night , especially these days , it’s very dangerous and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor . ”\\n “ Fifty ? ”\\n Harry gasped they would lose the lead , the lead he’d won in the last Quidditch match .\\n “ Fifty points each , ” said Professor McGonagall , breathing heavily through her long , pointed nose .\\n “ Professor please ” “ You can’t ” “ Don’t tell me what I can and can’t do , Potter .\\n Now get back to bed , all of you .\\n I’ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students . ”\\n A hundred and fifty points lost .\\n That put Gryffindor in last place .\\n In one night , they’d ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the House Cup .\\n Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach .\\n How could they ever make up for this ?\\n Harry didn’t sleep all night .\\n He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours .\\n Harry couldn’t think of anything to say to comfort him .\\n He knew Neville , like himself , was dreading the dawn .\\n What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they’d done ?\\n At first , Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the House points the next day thought there ’ d been a mistake .\\n How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday ?\\n And then the story started to spread : Harry Potter , the famous Harry Potter , their hero of two Quidditch matches , had lost them all those points , him and a couple of other stupid first years .\\n From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school , Harry was suddenly the most hated .\\n Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him , because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the House Cup .\\n Everywhere Harry went , people pointed and didn’t trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him .\\n Slytherins , on the other hand , clapped as he walked past them , whistling and cheering , “ Thanks Potter , we owe you one ! ”\\n Only Ron stood by him .\\n “ They’ll all forget this in a few weeks .\\n Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they’ve been here , and people still like them . ”\\n “ They’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go , though , have they ? ”\\n said Harry miserably .\\n “ Well no , ” Ron admitted .\\n It was a bit late to repair the damage , but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren’t his business from now on .\\n He’d had it with sneaking around and spying .\\n He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team .\\n “ Resign ? ”\\n Wood thundered .\\n “ What good’ll that do ?\\n How are we going to get any points back if we can’t win at Quidditch ? ”\\n But even Quidditch had lost its fun .\\n The rest of the team wouldn’t speak to Harry during practice , and if they had to speak about him , they called him “ the Seeker . ”\\n Hermione and Neville were suffering , too .\\n They didn’t have as bad a time as Harry , because they weren’t as well known , but nobody would speak to them , either .\\n Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class , keeping her head down and working in silence .\\n Harry was almost glad that the exams weren’t far away .\\n All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery .\\n He , Ron , and Hermione kept to themselves , working late into the night , trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions , learn charms and spells by heart , memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions .\\n Then , about a week before the exams were due to start , Harry’s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn’t concern him was put to an unexpected test .\\n Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon , he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead .\\n As he drew closer , he heard Quirrell’s voice .\\n “ No no not again , please ” It sounded as though someone was threatening him .\\n Harry moved closer .\\n “ All right all right ” he heard Quirrell sob .\\n Next second , Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban .\\n He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry .\\n He strode out of sight Harry didn’t think Quirrell had even noticed him .\\n He waited until Quirrell’s footsteps had disappeared , then peered into the classroom .\\n It was empty , but a door stood ajar at the other end .\\n Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he’d promised himself about not meddling .\\n All the same , he’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s Stones that Snape had just left the room , and from what Harry had just heard , Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step Quirrell seemed to have given in at last .\\n Harry went back to the library , where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy .\\n Harry told them what he’d heard .\\n “ Snape’s done it , then ! ”\\n said Ron .\\n “ If Quirrell’s told him how to break his Anti Dark Force spell ” “ There’s still Fluffy , though , ” said Hermione .\\n “ Maybe Snape’s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid , ” said Ron , looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them .\\n “ I bet there’s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three headed dog .\\n So what do we do , Harry ? ”\\n The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron’s eyes , but Hermione answered before Harry could .\\n “ Go to Dumbledore .\\n That’s what we should have done ages ago .\\n If we try anything ourselves we’ll be thrown out for sure . ”\\n “ But we’ve got no proof . ”\\n said Harry .\\n “ Quirrell’s too scared to back us up .\\n Snape’s only got to say he doesn’t know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor who do you think they’ll believe , him or us ?\\n It’s not exactly a secret we hate him , Dumbledore ’ ll think we made it up to get him sacked .\\n Filch wouldn’t help us if his life depended on it , he’s too friendly with Snape , and the more students get thrown out , the better , he’ll think .\\n And don’t forget , we’re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy .\\n That’ll take a lot of explaining . ”\\n Hermione looked convinced , but Ron didn’t .\\n “ If we just do a bit of poking around ” “ No , ” said Harry flatly , “ we’ve done enough poking around . ”\\n He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons .\\n The following morning , notes were delivered to Harry , Hermione , and Neville at the breakfast table .\\n They were all the same : Your detention will take place at eleven o’clock tonight .\\n Meet Mr Filch in the entrance hall .\\n Professor M .\\n McGonagall Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they’d lost .\\n He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost , but she didn’t say a word .\\n Like Harry , she felt they deserved what they’d got .\\n At eleven o’clock that night , they said good bye to Ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville .\\n Filch was already there and so was Malfoy .\\n Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention , too .\\n “ Follow me , ” said Filch , lighting a lamp and leading them outside .\\n “ I bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule again , won’t you , eh ? ”\\n he said , leering at them .\\n “ Oh yes hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me .\\n It’s just a pity they let the old punishments die out hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days , I’ve got the chains still in my office , keep ’ em well oiled in case they’re ever needed .\\n Right , off we go , and don’t think of running off , now , it’ll be worse for you if you do . ”\\n They marched off across the dark grounds .\\n Neville kept sniffing .\\n Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be .\\n It must be something really horrible , or Filch wouldn’t be sounding so delighted .\\n The moon was bright , but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness .\\n Ahead , Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid’s hut .\\n Then they heard a distant shout .\\n “ Is that you , Filch ?\\n Hurry up , I want ter get started . ”\\n Harry’s heart rose if they were going to be working with Hagrid it wouldn’t be so bad .\\n His relief must have showed in his face , because Filch said , “ I suppose you think you’ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf ?\\n Well , think again , boy it’s into the forest you’re going and I’m much mistaken if you’ll all come out in one piece . ”\\n At this , Neville let out a little moan , and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks .\\n “ The forest ? ”\\n he repeated , and he didn’t sound quite as cool as usual .\\n “ We can’t go in there at night there’s all sorts of things in there werewolves , I heard . ”\\n Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry’s robe and made a choking noise .\\n “ That’s your problem , isn’t it ? ”\\n said Filch , his voice cracking with glee .\\n “ Should’ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble , shouldn’t you ? ”\\n Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark , Fang at his heel .\\n He was carrying his large crossbow , and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder .\\n “ Abou ’ time , ” he said .\\n “ I bin waitin ’ fer half an hour already .\\n All right , Harry , Hermione ? ”\\n “ I shouldn’t be too friendly to them , Hagrid , ” said Filch coldly , “ they’re here to be punished , after all . ”\\n “ That’s why yer late , is it ? ”\\n said Hagrid , frowning at Filch .\\n “ Bin lecturin ’ them , eh ?\\n ’ Snot your place ter do that .\\n Yeh’ve done yer bit , I’ll take over from here . ”\\n “ I’ll be back at dawn , ” said Filch , “ for what’s left of them , ” he added nastily , and he turned and started back toward the castle , his lamp bobbing away in the darkness .\\n Malfoy now turned to Hagrid .\\n “ I’m not going in that forest , ” he said , and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice .\\n “ Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts , ” said Hagrid fiercely .\\n “ Yeh’ve done wrong an ’ now yeh’ve got ter pay fer it . ”\\n “ But this is servant stuff , it’s not for students to do .\\n I thought we’d be copying lines or something , if my father knew I was doing this , he’d ” “ tell yer that’s how it is at Hogwarts , ” Hagrid growled .\\n “ Copyin ’ lines !\\n What good’s that ter anyone ?\\n Yeh’ll do summat useful or yeh’ll get out .\\n If yeh think yer father’d rather you were expelled , then get back off ter the castle an ’ pack .\\n Go on ! ”\\n Malfoy didn’t move .\\n He looked at Hagrid furiously , but then dropped his gaze .\\n “ Right then , ” said Hagrid , “ now , listen carefully , ’ cause it’s dangerous what we’re gonna do tonight , an ’ I don ’ want no one takin ’ risks .\\n Follow me over here a moment . ”\\n He led them to the very edge of the forest .\\n Holding his lamp up high , he pointed down a narrow , winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees .\\n A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest .\\n “ Look there , ” said Hagrid , “ see that stuff shinin ’ on the ground ?\\n Silvery stuff ?\\n That’s unicorn blood .\\n There’s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat .\\n This is the second time in a week .\\n I found one dead last Wednesday .\\n We’re gonna try an ’ find the poor thing .\\n We might have ter put it out of its misery . ”\\n “ And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first ? ”\\n said Malfoy , unable to keep the fear out of his voice .\\n “ There’s nothin ’ that lives in the forest that’ll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang , ” said Hagrid .\\n “ An ’ keep ter the path .\\n Right , now , we’re gonna split inter two parties an ’ follow the trail in diff’rent directions .\\n There’s blood all over the place , it must’ve bin staggerin ’ around since last night at least . ”\\n “ I want Fang , ” said Malfoy quickly , looking at Fang’s long teeth .\\n “ All right , but I warn yeh , he’s a coward , ” said Hagrid .\\n “ So me , Harry , an ’ Hermione’ll go one way an ’ Draco , Neville , an ’ Fang’ll go the other .\\n Now , if any of us finds the unicorn , we’ll send up green sparks , right ?\\n Get yer wands out an ’ practice now that’s it an ’ if anyone gets in trouble , send up red sparks , an ’ we’ll all come an ’ find yeh so , be careful let’s go . ”\\n The forest was black and silent .\\n A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path , and Harry , Hermione , and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy , Neville , and Fang took the right .\\n They walked in silence , their eyes on the ground .\\n Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver blue blood on the fallen leaves .\\n Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried .\\n “ Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns ? ”\\n Harry asked .\\n “ Not fast enough , ” said Hagrid .\\n “ It’s not easy ter catch a unicorn , they’re powerful magic creatures .\\n I never knew one ter be hurt before . ”\\n They walked past a mossy tree stump .\\n Harry could hear running water there must be a stream somewhere close by .\\n There were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path .\\n “ You all right , Hermione ? ”\\n Hagrid whispered .\\n “ Don ’ worry , it can’t ’ ve gone far if it’s this badly hurt , an ’ then well be able ter GET BEHIND THAT TREE ! ”\\n Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak .\\n He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow , raising it , ready to fire .\\n The three of them listened .\\n Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby : it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground .\\n Hagrid was squinting up the dark path , but after a few seconds , the sound faded away .\\n “ I knew it , ” he murmured .\\n “ There’s summat in here that shouldn ’ be . ”\\n “ A werewolf ? ”\\n Harry suggested .\\n “ That wasn ’ no werewolf an ’ it wasn ’ no unicorn , neither , ” said Hagrid grimly .\\n “ Right , follow me , but careful , now . ”\\n They walked more slowly , ears straining for the faintest sound .\\n Suddenly , in a clearing ahead , something definitely moved .\\n “ Who’s there ? ”\\n Hagrid called .\\n “ Show yerself I’m armed ! ”\\n And into the clearing came was it a man , or a horse ?\\n To the waist , a man , with red hair and beard , but below that was a horse’s gleaming chestnut body with a long , reddish tail .\\n Harry and Hermione’s jaws dropped .\\n “ Oh , it’s you , Ronan , ” said Hagrid in relief .\\n “ How are yeh ? ”\\n He walked forward and shook the centaur’s hand .\\n “ Good evening to you , Hagrid , ” said Ronan .\\n He had a deep , sorrowful voice .\\n “ Were you going to shoot me ? ”\\n “ Can’t be too careful , Ronan , ” said Hagrid , patting his crossbow .\\n “ There’s summat bad loose in this forest .\\n This is Harry Potter an ’ Hermione Granger , by the way .\\n Students up at the school .\\n An ’ this is Ronan , you two .\\n He’s a centaur . ”\\n “ We’d noticed , ” said Hermione faintly .\\n “ Good evening , ” said Ronan .\\n “ Students , are you ?\\n And do you learn much , up at the school ? ”\\n “ Erm ” “ A bit , ” said Hermione timidly .\\n “ A bit .\\n Well , that’s something . ”\\n Ronan sighed .\\n He flung back his head and stared at the sky .\\n “ Mars is bright tonight . ”\\n “ Yeah , ” said Hagrid , glancing up , too .\\n “ Listen , I’m glad we’ve run inter yeh , Ronan , ’ cause there’s a unicorn bin hurt you seen anythin ’ ? ”\\n Ronan didn’t answer immediately .\\n He stared unblinkingly upward , then sighed again .\\n “ Always the innocent are the first victims , ” he said .\\n “ So it has been for ages past , so it is now . ”\\n “ Yeah , ” said Hagrid , “ but have yeh seen anythin ’ , Ronan ?\\n Anythin ’ unusual ? ”\\n “ Mars is bright tonight , ” Ronan repeated , while Hagrid watched him impatiently .\\n “ Unusually bright . ”\\n “ Yeah , but I was meanin ’ anythin ’ unusual a bit nearer home , ” said Hagrid .\\n “ So yeh haven’t noticed anythin ’ strange ? ”\\n Yet again , Ronan took a while to answer .\\n At last , he said , “ The forest hides many secrets . ”\\n A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again , but it was only a second centaur , black haired and bodied and wilder looking than Ronan .\\n “ Hullo , Bane , ” said Hagrid .\\n “ All right ? ”\\n “ Good evening , Hagrid , I hope you are well ? ”\\n “ Well enough .\\n Look , I’ve jus ’ bin askin ’ Ronan , you seen anythin ’ odd in here lately ?\\n There’s a unicorn bin injured would yeh know anythin ’ about it ? ”\\n Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan .\\n He looked skyward .\\n “ Mars is bright tonight , ” he said simply .\\n “ We’ve heard , ” said Hagrid grumpily .\\n “ Well , if either of you do see anythin ’ , let me know , won’t yeh ?\\n We’ll be off , then . ”\\n Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing , staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view .\\n “ Never , ” said Hagrid irritably , “ try an ’ get a straight answer out of a centaur .\\n Ruddy stargazers .\\n Not interested in anythin ’ closer’n the moon . ”\\n “ Are there many of them in here ? ”\\n asked Hermione .\\n “ Oh , a fair few .\\n Keep themselves to themselves mostly , but they’re good enough about turnin ’ up if ever I want a word .\\n They’re deep , mind , centaurs they know things jus ’ don ’ let on much . ”\\n “ D’you think that was a centaur we heard earlier ? ”\\n said Harry .\\n “ Did that sound like hooves to you ?\\n Nah , if yeh ask me , that was what’s bin killin ’ the unicorns never heard anythin ’ like it before . ”\\n They walked on through the dense , dark trees .\\n Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder .\\n He had the nasty feeling they were being watched .\\n He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them .\\n They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid ’ s arm .\\n “ Hagrid !\\n Look !\\n Red sparks , the others are in trouble ! ”\\n “ You two wait here ! ”\\n Hagrid shouted .\\n “ Stay on the path , I’ll come back for yeh ! ”\\n They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other , very scared , until they couldn’t hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them .\\n “ You don’t think they’ve been hurt , do you ? ”\\n whispered Hermione .\\n “ I don’t care if Malfoy has , but if something’s got Neville it’s our fault he’s here in the first place . ”\\n The minutes dragged by .\\n Their ears seemed sharper than usual .\\n Harry’s seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind , every cracking twig .\\n What was going on ?\\n Where were the others ?\\n At last , a great crunching noise announced Hagrid’s return .\\n Malfoy , Neville , and Fang were with him .\\n Hagrid was fuming .\\n Malfoy , it seemed , had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke .\\n Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks .\\n “ Well be lucky ter catch anythin ’ now , with the racket you two were makin ’ .\\n Right , we’re changin ’ groups Neville , you stay with me an ’ Hermione , Harry , you go with Fang an ’ this idiot .\\n I’m sorry , ” Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry , “ but he’ll have a harder time frightenin ’ you , an ’ we’ve gotta get this done . ”\\n So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang .\\n They walked for nearly half an hour , deeper and deeper into the forest , until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick .\\n Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker .\\n There were splashes on the roots of a tree , as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by .\\n Harry could see a clearing ahead , through the tangled branches of an ancient oak .\\n “ Look ” he murmured , holding out his arm to stop Malfoy .\\n Something bright white was gleaming on the ground .\\n They inched closer .\\n It was the unicorn all right , and it was dead .\\n Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad .\\n Its long , slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly white on the dark leaves .\\n Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood .\\n A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered .\\n Then , out of the shadows , a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast .\\n Harry , Malfoy , and Fang stood transfixed .\\n The cloaked figure reached the unicorn , lowered its head over the wound in the animals side , and began to drink its blood .\\n “ AAAAAAAAAAARGH ! ”\\n Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted so did Fang .\\n The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry unicorn blood was dribbling down its front .\\n It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry he couldn’t move for fear .\\n Then a pain like he’d never felt before pierced his head it was as though his scar were on fire .\\n Half blinded , he staggered backward .\\n He heard hooves behind him , galloping , and something jumped clean over Harry , charging at the figure .\\n The pain in Harry’s head was so bad he fell to his knees .\\n It took a minute or two to pass .\\n When he looked up , the figure had gone .\\n A centaur was standing over him , not Ronan or Bane this one looked younger he had white blond hair and a palomino body .\\n “ Are you all right ? ”\\n said the centaur , pulling Harry to his feet .\\n “ Yes thank you what was that ? ”\\n The centaur didn’t answer .\\n He had astonishingly blue eyes , like pale sapphires .\\n He looked carefully at Harry , his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out , livid , on Harry’s forehead .\\n “ You are the Potter boy , ” he said .\\n “ You had better get back to Hagrid .\\n The forest is not safe at this time especially for you .\\n Can you ride ?\\n It will be quicker this way .\\n “ My name is Firenze , ” he added , as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back .\\n There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing .\\n Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees , their flanks heaving and sweaty .\\n “ Firenze ! ”\\n Bane thundered .\\n “ What are you doing ?\\n You have a human on your back !\\n Have you no shame ?\\n Are you a common mule ? ”\\n “ Do you realize who this is ? ”\\n said Firenze .\\n “ This is the Potter boy .\\n The quicker he leaves this forest , the better . ”\\n “ What have you been telling him ? ”\\n growled Bane .\\n “ Remember , Firenze , we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens .\\n Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets ? ”\\n Ronan pawed the ground nervously .\\n “ I’m sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best , ” he said in his gloomy voice .\\n Bane kicked his back legs in anger .\\n “ For the best !\\n What is that to do with us ?\\n Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold !\\n It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest ! ”\\n Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger , so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on .\\n “ Do you not see that unicorn ? ”\\n Firenze bellowed at Bane .\\n “ Do you not understand why it was killed ?\\n Or have the planets not let you in on that secret ?\\n I set myself against what is lurking in this forest , Bane , yes , with humans alongside me if I must . ”\\n And Firenze whisked around with Harry clutching on as best he could , they plunged off into the trees , leaving Ronan and Bane behind them .\\n Harry didn’t have a clue what was going on .\\n “ Why’s Bane so angry ? ”\\n he asked .\\n “ What was that thing you saved me from , anyway ? ”\\n Firenze slowed to a walk , warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low hanging branches , but did not answer Harry’s question .\\n They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn’t want to talk to him anymore .\\n They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees , however , when Firenze suddenly stopped .\\n “ Harry Potter , do you know what unicorn blood is used for ? ”\\n “ No , ” said Harry , startled by the odd question .\\n “ We’ve only used the horn and tail hair in Potions . ”\\n “ That is because it is a monstrous thing , to slay a unicorn , ” said Firenze .\\n “ Only one who has nothing to lose , and everything to gain , would commit such a crime .\\n The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive , even if you are an inch from death , but at a terrible price .\\n You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself , and you will have but a half life , a cursed life , from the moment the blood touches your lips . ”\\n Harry stared at the back of Firenze’s head , which was dappled silver in the moonlight .\\n “ But who’d be that desperate ? ”\\n he wondered aloud .\\n “ If you’re going to be cursed forever , death’s better , isn’t it ? ”\\n “ It is , ” Firenze agreed , “ unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else something that will bring you back to full strength and power something that will mean you can never die .\\n Mr Potter , do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment ? ”\\n “ The Sorcerer’s Stone !\\n Of course the Elixir of Life !\\n But I don’t understand who ” “ Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power , who has clung to life , awaiting their chance ? ”\\n It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry’s heart .\\n Over the rustling of the trees , he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met : “ Some say he died .\\n Codswallop , in my opinion .\\n Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die . ”\\n “ Do you mean , ” Harry croaked , “ that was VoZ ” “ Harry !\\n Harry , are you all right ? ”\\n Hermione was running toward them down the path , Hagrid puffing along behind her .\\n “ I’m fine , ” said Harry , hardly knowing what he was saying .\\n “ The unicorn’s dead , Hagrid , it’s in that clearing back there . ”\\n “ This is where I leave you , ” Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn .\\n “ You are safe now . ”\\n Harry slid off his back .\\n “ Good luck , Harry Potter , ” said Firenze .\\n “ The planets have been read wrongly before now , even by centaurs .\\n I hope this is one of those times . ”\\n He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest , leaving Harry shivering behind him .\\n Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room , waiting for them to return .\\n He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake .\\n In a matter of seconds , though , he was wide eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest .\\n Harry couldn’t sit down .\\n He paced up and down in front of the fire .\\n He was still shaking .\\n “ Snape wants the Stone for Voldemort and Voldemort’s waiting in the forest and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich . ”\\n “ Stop saying the name ! ”\\n said Ron in a terrified whisper , as if he thought Voldemort could hear them .\\n Harry wasn’t listening .\\n “ Firenze saved me , but he shouldn’t have done so .\\n Bane was furious he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen .\\n They must show that Voldemort’s coming back .\\n Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me .\\n I suppose that’s written in the stars as well . ”\\n “ Will you stop saying the name ” Ron hissed .\\n “ So all I’ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone , ” Harry went on feverishly , “ then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off .\\n Well , I suppose Bane 11 be happy . ”\\n Hermione looked very frightened , but she had a word of comfort .\\n “ Harry , everyone says Dumbledore’s the only one You Know Who was ever afraid of .\\n With Dumbledore around , You Know Who won’t touch you .\\n Anyway , who says the centaurs are right ?\\n It sounds like fortune telling to me , and Professor McGonagall says that’s a very imprecise branch of magic . ”\\n The sky had turned light before they stopped talking .\\n They went to bed exhausted , their throats sore .\\n But the night’s surprises weren’t over .\\n When Harry pulled back his sheets , he found his Invisibility Cloak folded neatly underneath them .\\n There was a note pinned to it : Just in case .',\n",
       "   'Chapter : QUIDDITCH As they entered November , the weather turned very cold .\\n The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel .\\n Every morning the ground was covered in frost .\\n Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field , bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat , rabbit fur gloves , and enormous beaverskin boots .\\n The Quidditch season had begun .\\n On Saturday , Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training : Gryffindor versus Slytherin .\\n If Gryffindor won , they would move up into second place in the House Championship .\\n Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that , as their secret weapon , Harry should be kept , well , secret .\\n But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow , and Harry didn’t know which was worse people telling him he’d be brilliant or people telling him they’d be running around underneath him holding a mattress .\\n It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend .\\n He didn’t know how he’d have gotten through all his homework without her , what with all the last minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do .\\n She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages , which turned out to be a very interesting read .\\n Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473 that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players , and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them that although people rarely died playing Quidditch , referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert .\\n Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll , and she was much nicer for it .\\n The day before Harry’s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break , and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar .\\n They were standing with their backs to it , getting warm , when Snape crossed the yard .\\n Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping .\\n Harry , Ron , and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view they were sure it wouldn’t be allowed .\\n Unfortunately , something about their guilty faces caught Snape’s eye .\\n He limped over .\\n He hadn’t seen the fire , but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway .\\n “ What’s that you’ve got there , Potter ? ”\\n It was Quidditch Through the Ages .\\n Harry showed him .\\n “ Library books are not to be taken outside the school , ” said Snape .\\n “ Give it to me .\\n Five points from Gryffindor . ”\\n “ He’s just made that rule up , ” Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away .\\n “ Wonder what’s wrong with his leg ? ”\\n “ Dunno , but I hope it’s really hurting him , ” said Ron bitterly .\\n The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening .\\n Harry , Ron , and Hermione sat together next to a window .\\n Hermione was checking Harry and Ron’s Charms homework for them .\\n She would never let them copy ( “ How will you learn ? ” ) ,\\n but by asking her to read it through , they got the right answers anyway .\\n Harry felt restless .\\n He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back , to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow .\\n Why should he be afraid of Snape ?\\n Getting up , he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it .\\n “ Better you than me , ” they said together , but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn’t refuse if there were other teachers listening .\\n He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked .\\n There was no answer .\\n He knocked again .\\n Nothing .\\n Perhaps Snape had left the book in there ?\\n It was worth a try .\\n He pushed the door ajar and peered inside and a horrible scene met his eyes .\\n Snape and Filch were inside , alone .\\n Snape was holding his robes above his knees .\\n One of his legs was bloody and mangled .\\n Filch was handing Snape bandages .\\n “ Blasted thing , ” Snape was saying .\\n “ How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once ? ”\\n Harry tried to shut the door quietly , but “ POTTER ! ”\\n Snape ’ s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg .\\n Harry gulped .\\n “ I just wondered if I could have my book back . ”\\n “ GET OUT !\\n OUT ! ”\\n Harry left , before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor .\\n He sprinted back upstairs .\\n “ Did you get it ? ”\\n Ron asked as Harry joined them .\\n “ What’s the matter ? ”\\n In a low whisper , Harry told them what he’d seen .\\n “ You know what this means ? ”\\n he finished breathlessly .\\n “ He tried to get past that three headed dog at Halloween !\\n That’s where he was going when we saw him he’s after whatever it’s guarding !\\n And I’d bet my broomstick he let that troll in , to make a diversion ! ”\\n Hermione’s eyes were wide .\\n “ No he wouldn’t , ” she said .\\n “ I know he’s not very nice , but he wouldn’t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe . ”\\n “ Honestly , Hermione , you think all teachers are saints or something , ” snapped Ron .\\n “ I’m with Harry .\\n I wouldn’t put anything past Snape .\\n But what’s he after ?\\n What’s that dog guarding ? ”\\n Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question .\\n Neville was snoring loudly , but Harry couldn’t sleep .\\n He tried to empty his mind he needed to sleep , he had to , he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours but the expression on Snape’s face when Harry had seen his leg wasn’t easy to forget .\\n The next morning dawned very bright and cold .\\n The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match .\\n “ You’ve got to eat some breakfast . ”\\n “ I don’t want anything . ”\\n “ Just a bit of toast , ” wheedled Hermione .\\n “ I’m not hungry . ”\\n Harry felt terrible .\\n In an hour’s time he’d be walking onto the field .\\n “ Harry , you need your strength , ” said Seamus Finnigan .\\n “ Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team . ”\\n “ Thanks , Seamus , ” said Harry , watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages .\\n By eleven o’clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch .\\n Many students had binoculars .\\n The seats might be raised high in the air , but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes .\\n Ron and Hermione joined Neville , Seamus , and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row .\\n As a surprise for Harry , they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined .\\n It said Potter for President , and Dean , who was good at drawing , had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath .\\n Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors .\\n Meanwhile , in the locker room , Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes ( Slytherin would be playing in green ) .\\n Wood cleared his throat for silence .\\n “ Okay , men , ” he said .\\n “ And women , ” said Chaser Angelina Johnson .\\n “ And women , ” Wood agreed .\\n “ This is it . ”\\n “ The big one , ” said Fred Weasley .\\n “ The one we’ve all been waiting for , ” said George .\\n “ We know Oliver’s speech by heart , ” Fred told Harry , “ we were on the team last year . ”\\n “ Shut up , you two , ” said Wood .\\n “ This is the best team Gryffindor’s had in years .\\n We’re going to win .\\n I know it . ”\\n He glared at them all as if to say , “ Or else . ”\\n “ Right .\\n It’s time .\\n Good luck , all of you . ”\\n Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and , hoping his knees weren’t going to give way , walked onto the field to loud cheers .\\n Madam Hooch was refereeing .\\n She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams , her broom in her hand .\\n “ Now , I want a nice fair game , all of you , ” she said , once they were all gathered around her .\\n Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain , Marcus Flint , a fifth year .\\n Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him .\\n Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above , flashing Potter for President over the crowd .\\n His heart skipped .\\n He felt braver .\\n “ Mount your brooms , please . ”\\n Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand .\\n Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle .\\n Fifteen brooms rose up , high , high into the air .\\n They were off .\\n “ And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor what an excellent Chaser that girl is , and rather attractive , too ” “ JORDAN ! ”\\n “ Sorry , Professor . ”\\n The Weasley twins ’ friend , Lee Jordan , was doing the commentary for the match , closely watched by Professor McGonagall .\\n “ And she’s really belting along up there , a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet , a good find of Oliver Wood’s , last year only a reserve back to Johnson and no , the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle , Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes Flint flying like an eagle up there he’s going to sc no , stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle that’s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there , nice dive around Flint , off up the field and OUCH that must have hurt , hit in the back of the head by a Bludger Quaffle taken by the Slytherins that’s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts , but he’s blocked by a second Bludger sent his way by Fred or George Weasley , can’t tell which nice play by the Gryffindor Beater , anyway , and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle , a clear field ahead and off she goes she’s really flying dodges a speeding Bludger the goal posts are ahead come on , now , Angelina Keeper Bletchley dives misses GRYFFINDORS SCORE ! ”\\n Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air , with howls and moans from the Slytherins .\\n “ Budge up there , move along . ”\\n “ Hagrid ! ”\\n Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them .\\n “ Bin watchin ’ from me hut , ” said Hagrid , patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck , “ But it isn’t the same as bein ’ in the crowd .\\n No sign of the Snitch yet , eh ? ”\\n “ Nope , ” said Ron .\\n “ Harry hasn’t had much to do yet . ”\\n “ Kept outta trouble , though , that’s somethin ’ , ” said Hagrid , raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry .\\n Way up above them , Harry was gliding over the game , squinting about for some sign of the Snitch .\\n This was part of his and Wood’s game plan .\\n “ Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch , ” Wood had said .\\n “ We don’t want you attacked before you have to be . ”\\n When Angelina had scored , Harry had done a couple of loop the loops to let off his feelings .\\n Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch .\\n Once he caught sight of a flash of gold , but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys ’ wristwatches , and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way , more like a cannonball than anything , but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it .\\n “ All right there , Harry ? ”\\n he had time to yell , as he beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint .\\n “ Slytherin in possession , ” Lee Jordan was saying , “ Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers , two Weasleys , and Chaser Bell , and speeds toward the wait a moment was that the Snitch ? ”\\n A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle , too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear .\\n Harry saw it .\\n In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold .\\n Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it , too .\\n Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch .\\n Harry was faster than Higgs he could see the little round ball , wings fluttering , darting up ahead he put on an extra spurt of speed WHAM !\\n A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose , and Harry’s broom spun off course , Harry holding on for dear life .\\n “ Foul ! ”\\n screamed the Gryffindors .\\n Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor .\\n But in all the confusion , of course , the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again .\\n Down in the stands , Dean Thomas was yelling , “ Send him off , ref !\\n Red card ! ”\\n “ What are you talking about , Dean ? ”\\n said Ron .\\n “ Red card ! ”\\n said Dean furiously .\\n “ In soccer you get shown the red card and you’re out of the game ! ”\\n “ But this isn’t soccer , Dean , ” Ron reminded him .\\n Hagrid , however , was on Dean’s side .\\n “ They oughta change the rules .\\n Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air . ”\\n Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides .\\n “ So after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating ” “ Jordan ! ”\\n growled Professor McGonagall .\\n “ I mean , after that open and revolting foul ” “ Jordan , I’m warning you ” “ All right , all right .\\n Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker , which could happen to anyone , I’m sure , so a penalty to Gryffindor , taken by Spinnet , who puts it away , no trouble , and we continue play , Gryffindor still in possession . ”\\n It was as Harry dodged another Bludger , which went spinning dangerously past his head , that it happened .\\n His broom gave a sudden , frightening lurch .\\n For a split second , he thought he was going to fall .\\n He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees .\\n He’d never felt anything like that .\\n It happened again .\\n It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off .\\n But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off .\\n Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal posts he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time out and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control .\\n He couldn’t turn it .\\n He couldn’t direct it at all .\\n It was zigzagging through the air , and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him .\\n Lee was still commentating .\\n “ Slytherin in possession Flint with the Quaffle passes Spinnet passes Bell hit hard in the face by a Bludger , hope it broke his nose only joking , Professor Slytherins score oh no ” The Slytherins were cheering .\\n No one seemed to have noticed that Harry’s broom was behaving strangely It was carrying him slowly higher , away from the game , jerking and twitching as it went .\\n “ Dunno what Harry thinks he’s doing , ” Hagrid mumbled .\\n He stared through his binoculars .\\n “ If I didn ’ know better , I’d say he’d lost control of his broom but he can’t have . ”\\n Suddenly , people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands .\\n His broom had started to roll over and over , with him only just managing to hold on .\\n Then the whole crowd gasped .\\n Harry’s broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it .\\n He was now dangling from it , holding on with only one hand .\\n “ Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him ? ”\\n Seamus whispered .\\n “ Can’t have , ” Hagrid said , his voice shaking .\\n “ Can’t nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand . ”\\n At these words , Hermione seized Hagrid ’ s binoculars , but instead of looking up at Harry , she started looking frantically at the crowd .\\n “ What are you doing ? ”\\n moaned Ron , gray faced .\\n “ I knew it , ” Hermione gasped , “ Snape look . ”\\n Ron grabbed the binoculars .\\n Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them .\\n He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath .\\n “ He’s doing something jinxing the broom , ” said Hermione .\\n “ What should we do ? ”\\n “ Leave it to me . ”\\n Before Ron could say another word , Hermione had disappeared .\\n Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry .\\n His broom was vibrating so hard , it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer .\\n The whole crowd was on its feet , watching , terrified , as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms , but it was no good every time they got near him , the broom would jump higher still .\\n They dropped lower and circled beneath him , obviously hoping to catch him if he fell .\\n Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing .\\n “ Come on , Hermione , ” Ron muttered desperately .\\n Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood , and was now racing along the row behind him she didn’t even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front .\\n Reaching Snape , she crouched down , pulled out her wand , and whispered a few , well chosen words .\\n Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape ’ s robes .\\n It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire .\\n A sudden yelp told her she had done her job .\\n Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket , she scrambled back along the row Snape would never know what had happened .\\n It was enough .\\n Up in the air , Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom .\\n “ Neville , you can look ! ”\\n Ron said .\\n Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid’s jacket for the last five minutes .\\n Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick he hit the field on all fours coughed and something gold fell into his hand .\\n “ I’ve got the Snitch ! ”\\n he shouted , waving it above his head , and the game ended in complete confusion .\\n “ He didn’t catch it , he nearly swallowed it , ” Flint was still howling twenty minutes later , but it made no difference Harry hadn’t broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty .\\n Harry heard none of this , though .\\n He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid’s hut , with Ron and Hermione .\\n “ It was Snape , ” Ron was explaining , “ Hermione and I saw him .\\n He was cursing your broomstick , muttering , he wouldn’t take his eyes off you . ”\\n “ Rubbish , ” said Hagrid , who hadn’t heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands .\\n “ Why would Snape do somethin ’ like that ? ”\\n Harry , Ron , and Hermione looked at one another , wondering what to tell him .\\n Harry decided on the truth .\\n “ I found out something about him , ” he told Hagrid .\\n “ He tried to get past that three headed dog on Halloween .\\n It bit him .\\n We think he was trying to steal whatever it’s guarding . ”\\n Hagrid dropped the teapot .\\n “ How do you know about Fluffy ? ”\\n he said .\\n “ Fluffy ? ”\\n “ Yeah he’s mine bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las ’ year I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the ” “ Yes ? ”\\n said Harry eagerly .\\n “ Now , don’t ask me anymore , ” said Hagrid gruffly .\\n “ That’s top secret , that is . ”\\n “ But Snape’s trying to steal it . ”\\n “ Rubbish , ” said Hagrid again .\\n “ Snape’s a Hogwarts teacher , he’d do nothin ’ of the sort . ”\\n “ So why did he just try and kill Harry ? ”\\n cried Hermione .\\n The afternoon’s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape .\\n “ I know a jinx when I see one , Hagrid , I’ve read all about them !\\n You’ve got to keep eye contact , and Snape wasn’t blinking at all , I saw him ! ”\\n “ I’m tellin ’ yeh , yer wrong ! ”\\n said Hagrid hotly .\\n “ I don ’ know why Harry’s broom acted like that , but Snape wouldn ’ try an ’ kill a student !\\n Now , listen to me , all three of yeh yer meddlin ’ in things that don ’ concern yeh .\\n It’s dangerous .\\n You forget that dog , an ’ you forget what it’s guardin ’ , that’s between Professor Dumbledore an ’ Nicolas Flamel ” “ Aha ! ”\\n said Harry , “ so there’s someone called Nicolas Flamel involved , is there ? ”\\n Hagrid looked furious with himself .',\n",
       "   'Chapter : THE VANASHIG GLASS .\\n Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step , but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all .\\n The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys ’ front door it crept into their living room , which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls .\\n Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed .\\n Ten years ago , there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different colored bonnets but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby , and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle , on a carousel at the fair , playing a computer game with his father , being hugged and kissed by his mother .\\n The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house , too .\\n Yet Harry Potter was still there , asleep at the moment , but not for long .\\n His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day .\\n “ Up !\\n Get up !\\n Now ! ”\\n Harry woke with a start .\\n His aunt rapped on the door again .\\n “ Up ! ”\\n she screeched .\\n Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove .\\n He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having .\\n It had been a good one .\\n There had been a flying motorcycle in it .\\n He had a funny feeling he’d had the same dream before .\\n His aunt was back outside the door .\\n “ Are you up yet ? ”\\n she demanded .\\n “ Nearly , ” said Harry .\\n “ Well , get a move on , I want you to look after the bacon .\\n And don’t you dare let it burn , I want everything perfect on Duddy’s birthday . ”\\n Harry groaned .\\n “ What did you say ? ”\\n his aunt snapped through the door .\\n “ Nothing , nothing ” Dudley’s birthday how could he have forgotten ?\\n Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks .\\n He found a pair under his bed and , after pulling a spider off one of them , put them on .\\n Harry was used to spiders , because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them , and that was where he slept .\\n When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen .\\n The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley’s birthday presents .\\n It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted , not to mention the second television and the racing bike .\\n Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry , as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise unless of course it involved punching somebody .\\n Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry , but he couldn’t often catch him .\\n Harry didn’t look it , but he was very fast .\\n Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard , but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age .\\n He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley’s , and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was .\\n Harry had a thin face , knobbly knees , black hair , and bright green eyes .\\n He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose .\\n The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning .\\n He had had it as long as he could remember , and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it .\\n “ In the car crash when your parents died , ” she had said .\\n “ And don’t ask questions . ”\\n Don’t ask questions that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys .\\n Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon .\\n “ Comb your hair ! ”\\n he barked , by way of a morning greeting .\\n About once a week , Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut .\\n Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together , but it made no difference , his hair simply grew that way all over the place .\\n Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother .\\n Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon .\\n He had a large pink face , not much neck , small , watery blue eyes , and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick , fat head .\\n Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig .\\n Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table , which was difficult as there wasn’t much room .\\n Dudley , meanwhile , was counting his presents .\\n His face fell .\\n “ Thirty six , ” he said , looking up at his mother and father .\\n “ That’s two less than last year . ”\\n “ Darling , you haven’t counted Auntie Marge’s present , see , it’s here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy . ”\\n “ All right , thirty seven then , ” said Dudley , going red in the face .\\n Harry , who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on , began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over .\\n Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger , too , because she said quickly , “ And we’ll buy you another two presents while we’re out today .\\n How’s that , popkin ?\\n Two more presents .\\n Is that all right ? ”\\n Dudley thought for a moment .\\n It looked like hard work .\\n Finally he said slowly , “ So I’ll have thirty thirty ” “ Thirty nine , sweetums , ” said Aunt Petunia .\\n “ Oh . ”\\n Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel .\\n “ All right then . ”\\n Uncle Vernon chuckled .\\n “ Little tyke wants his money’s worth , just like his father .\\n ’ Atta boy , Dudley ! ”\\n He ruffled Dudley’s hair .\\n At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike , a video camera , a remote control airplane , sixteen new computer games , and a VCR .\\n He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried .\\n “ Bad news , Vernon , ” she said .\\n “ Mrs Figg’s broken her leg .\\n She can’t take him . ”\\n She jerked her head in Harry’s direction .\\n Dudley’s mouth fell open in horror , but Harry’s heart gave a leap .\\n Every year on Dudley’s birthday , his parents took him and a friend out for the day , to adventure parks , hamburger restaurants , or the movies .\\n Every year , Harry was left behind with Mrs Figg , a mad old lady who lived two streets away .\\n Harry hated it there .\\n The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she’d ever owned .\\n “ Now what ? ”\\n said Aunt Petunia , looking furiously at Harry as though he’d planned this .\\n Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs Figg had broken her leg , but it wasn’t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbies , Snowy , Mr Paws , and Tufty again .\\n “ We could phone Marge , ” Uncle Vernon suggested .\\n “ Don’t be silly , Vernon , she hates the boy . ”\\n The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this , as though he wasn’t there or rather , as though he was something very nasty that couldn’t understand them , like a slug .\\n “ What about what’s her name , your friend Yvonne ? ”\\n “ On vacation in Majorca , ” snapped Aunt Petunia .\\n “ You could just leave me here , ” Harry put in hopefully ( he’d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley’s computer ) .\\n Aunt Petunia looked as though she’d just swallowed a lemon .\\n “ And come back and find the house in ruins ? ”\\n she snarled .\\n “ I won’t blow up the house , ” said Harry , but they weren’t listening .\\n “ I suppose we could take him to the zoo , ” said Aunt Petunia slowly , “ and leave him in the car . ”\\n “ That cars new , he’s not sitting in it alone . ”\\n Dudley began to cry loudly .\\n In fact , he wasn’t really crying it had been years since he’d really cried but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed , his mother would give him anything he wanted .\\n “ Dinky Duddydums , don’t cry , Mummy won’t let him spoil your special day ! ”\\n she cried , flinging her arms around him .\\n “ I don’t want him t t to come ! ”\\n Dudley yelled between huge , pretend sobs .\\n “ He always sp spoils everything ! ”\\n He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms .\\n Just then , the doorbell rang “ Oh , good Lord , they’re here ! ”\\n said Aunt Petunia frantically and a moment later , Dudley’s best friend , Piers Polkiss , walked in with his mother .\\n Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat .\\n He was usually the one who held people’s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them .\\n Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once .\\n Half an hour later , Harry , who couldn’t believe his luck , was sitting in the back of the Dursleys ’ car with Piers and Dudley , on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life .\\n His aunt and uncle hadn’t been able to think of anything else to do with him , but before they’d left , Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside .\\n “ I’m warning you , ” he had said , putting his large purple face right up close to Harry’s , “ I’m warning you now , boy any funny business , anything at all and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas . ”\\n I’m not going to do anything , ” said Harry , “ honestly But Uncle Vernon didn’t believe him .\\n No one ever did .\\n The problem was , strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn’t make them happen .\\n Once , Aunt Petunia , tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn’t been at all , had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs , which she left “ to hide that horrible scar . ”\\n Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry , who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day , where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses .\\n Next morning , however , he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off .\\n He had been given a week in his cupboard for this , even though he had tried to explain that he couldn’t explain how it had grown back so quickly .\\n Another time , Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley’s ( brown with orange puff balls ) .\\n The harder she tried to pull it over his head , the smaller it seemed to become , until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet , but certainly wouldn’t fit Harry .\\n Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and , to his great relief , Harry wasn’t punished .\\n On the other hand , he’d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens .\\n Dudley’s gang had been chasing him as usual when , as much to Harry’s surprise as anyone else’s , there he was sitting on the chimney .\\n The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry’s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings .\\n But all he’d tried to do ( as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard ) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors .\\n Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid jump .\\n But today , nothing was going to go wrong .\\n It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn’t school , his cupboard , or Mrs Figg’s cabbage smelling living room .\\n While he drove , Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia .\\n He liked to complain about things : people at work , Harry , the council , Harry , the bank , and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects .\\n This morning , it was motorcycles . “\\n roaring along like maniacs , the young hoodlums , ” he said , as a motorcycle overtook them .\\n “ I had a dream about a motorcycle , ” said Harry , remembering suddenly .\\n “ It was flying . ”\\n Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front .\\n He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry , his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache : “ MOTORCYCLES DONT FLY ! ”\\n Dudley and Piers sniggered .\\n “ I know they don’t , ” said Harry .\\n “ It was only a dream . ”\\n But he wished he hadn’t said anything .\\n If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions , it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn’t , no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas .\\n It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families .\\n The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then , because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away , they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop .\\n It wasn’t bad , either , Harry thought , licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley , except that it wasn’t blond .\\n Harry had the best morning he’d had in a long time .\\n He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers , who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime , wouldn’t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him .\\n They ate in the zoo restaurant , and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice cream on top , Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first .\\n Harry felt , afterward , that he should have known it was all too good to last .\\n After lunch they went to the reptile house .\\n It was cool and dark in there , with lit windows all along the walls .\\n Behind the glass , all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone .\\n Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge , poisonous cobras and thick , man crushing pythons .\\n Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place .\\n It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon’s car and crushed it into a trash can but at the moment it didn’t look in the mood .\\n In fact , it was fast asleep .\\n Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass , staring at the glistening brown coils .\\n “ Make it move , ” he whined at his father .\\n Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass , but the snake didn’t budge .\\n “ Do it again , ” Dudley ordered .\\n Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles , but the snake just snoozed on .\\n “ This is boring , ” Dudley moaned .\\n He shuffled away .\\n Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake .\\n He wouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long .\\n It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom , where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up at least he got to visit the rest of the house .\\n The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes .\\n Slowly , very slowly , it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry’s .\\n It winked .\\n Harry stared .\\n Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching .\\n They weren’t .\\n He looked back at the snake and winked , too .\\n The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley , then raised its eyes to the ceiling .\\n It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly : “ I get that all the time . ”\\n “ I know , ” Harry murmured through the glass , though he wasn’t sure the snake could hear him .\\n “ It must be really annoying . ”\\n The snake nodded vigorously .\\n “ Where do you come from , anyway ? ”\\n Harry asked .\\n The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass .\\n Harry peered at it .\\n Boa Constrictor , Brazil .\\n “ Was it nice there ? ”\\n The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on : This specimen was bred in the zoo .\\n “ Oh , I see so you’ve never been to Brazil ? ”\\n As the snake shook its head , a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump .\\n “ DUDLEY !\\n MR DURSLEY !\\n COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE !\\n YOU WONT BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING ! ”\\n Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could .\\n “ Out of the way , you , ” he said , punching Harry in the ribs .\\n Caught by surprise , Harry fell hard on the concrete floor .\\n What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened one second , Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass , the next , they had leapt back with howls of horror .\\n Harry sat up and gasped the glass front of the boa constrictor’s tank had vanished .\\n The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly , slithering out onto the floor .\\n People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits .\\n As the snake slid swiftly past him , Harry could have sworn a low , hissing voice said , “ Brazil , here I come .\\n Thanksss , amigo . ”\\n The keeper of the reptile house was in shock .\\n “ But the glass , ” he kept saying , “ where did the glass go ? ” “\\n The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong , sweet tea while he apologized over and over again .\\n Piers and Dudley could only gibber .\\n As far as Harry had seen , the snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed , but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car , Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg , while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death .\\n But worst of all , for Harry at least , was Piers calming down enough to say , “ Harry was talking to it , weren’t you , Harry ? ”\\n Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry .\\n He was so angry he could hardly speak .\\n He managed to say , “ Go cupboard stay no meals , ” before he collapsed into a chair , and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy .\\n Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later , wishing he had a watch .\\n He didn’t know what time it was and he couldn’t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet .\\n Until they were , he couldn’t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food .\\n He’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years , ten miserable years , as long as he could remember , ever since he’d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash .\\n He couldn’t remember being in the car when his parents had died .\\n Sometimes , when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard , he came up with a strange vision : a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead .\\n This , he supposed , was the crash , though he couldn’t imagine where all the green light came from .\\n He couldn’t remember his parents at all .\\n His aunt and uncle never spoke about them , and of course he was forbidden to ask questions .\\n There were no photographs of them in the house .\\n When he had been younger , Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away , but it had never happened the Dursleys were his only family .\\n Yet sometimes he thought ( or maybe hoped ) that strangers in the street seemed to know him .\\n Very strange strangers they were , too .\\n A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley .\\n After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man , Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything .\\n A wild looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus .\\n A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word .\\n The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look .\\n At school , Harry had no one .\\n Everybody knew that Dudley’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses , and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s gang .',\n",
       "   'Chapter : THE MAN WITH TWO FACES .\\n It was Quirrell .\\n “ You ” gasped Harry .\\n Quirrell smiled .\\n His face wasn’t twitching at all .\\n “ Me , ” he said calmly .\\n “ I wondered whether I’d be meeting you here , Potter . ”\\n “ But I thought Snape ” “ Severus ? ”\\n Quirrell laughed , and it wasn’t his usual quivering treble , either , but cold and sharp .\\n “ Yes , Severus does seem the type , doesn’t he ?\\n So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat .\\n Next to him , who would suspect p p poor , st stuttering P Professor Quirrell ? ”\\n Harry couldn’t take it in .\\n This couldn’t be true , it couldn’t .\\n “ But Snape tried to kill me ! ”\\n “ No , no , no .\\n tried to kill you .\\n Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match .\\n She broke my eye contact with you .\\n Another few seconds and I’d have got you off that broom .\\n I’d have managed it before then if Snape hadn’t been muttering a countercurse , trying to save you . ”\\n “ Snape was trying to save me ? ”\\n “ Of course , ” said Quirrell coolly .\\n “ Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match ?\\n He was trying to make sure I didn’t do it again .\\n Funny , really he needn’t have bothered .\\n I couldn’t do anything with Dumbledore watching .\\n All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning , he did make himself unpopular and what a waste of time , when after all that , I’m going to kill you tonight . ”\\n Quirrell snapped his fingers .\\n Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry .\\n “ You’re too nosy to live , Potter .\\n Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that , for all I knew you’d seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone . ”\\n “ You let the troll in ? ”\\n “ Certainly .\\n I have a special gift with trolls you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there ?\\n Unfortunately , while everyone else was running around looking for it , Snape , who already suspected me , went straight to the third floor to head me off and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death , that three headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape ’ s leg off properly .\\n “ Now , wait quietly , Potter .\\n I need to examine this interesting mirror . ”\\n It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell .\\n It was the Mirror of Erised .\\n “ This mirror is the key to finding the Stone , ” Quirrell murmured , tapping his way around the frame .\\n “ Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this but he’s in London I’ll be far away by the time he gets back . ”\\n All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror .\\n “ I saw you and Snape in the forest ” he blurted out .\\n “ Yes , ” said Quirrell idly , walking around the mirror to look at the back .\\n “ He was on to me by that time , trying to find out how far I’d got .\\n He suspected me all along .\\n Tried to frighten me as though he could , when I had Lord Voldemort on my side . ”\\n Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it .\\n “ I see the Stone I’m presenting it to my master but where is it ? ”\\n Harry struggled against the ropes binding him , but they didn’t give .\\n He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror .\\n “ But Snape always seemed to hate me so much . ”\\n “ Oh , he does , ” said Quirrell casually , “ heavens , yes .\\n He was at Hogwarts with your father , didn’t you know ?\\n They loathed each other .\\n But he never wanted you dead . ”\\n “ But I heard you a few days ago , sobbing I thought Snape was threatening you .\\n For the first time , a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell’s face .\\n “ Sometimes , ” he said , “ I find it hard to follow my master’s instructions he is a great wizard and I am weak ” “ You mean he was there in the classroom with you ? ”\\n Harry gasped .\\n “ He is with me wherever I go , ” said Quirrell quietly .\\n “ I met him when I traveled around the world .\\n A foolish young man I was then , full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil .\\n Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was .\\n There is no good and evil , there is only power , and those too weak to seek it .\\n Since then , I have served him faithfully , although I have let him down many times .\\n He has had to be very hard on me . ”\\n Quirrell shivered suddenly .\\n “ He does not forgive mistakes easily .\\n When I failed to steal the Stone from Gringotts , he was most displeased .\\n He punished me decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me . ”\\n Quirrell’s voice trailed away .\\n Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley how could he have been so stupid ?\\n He’d seen Quirrell there that very day , shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron .\\n Quirrell cursed under his breath .\\n “ I don’t understand is the Stone inside the mirror ?\\n Should I break it ? ”\\n Harry’s mind was racing .\\n What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment , he thought , is to find the Stone before Quirrell does .\\n So if I look in the mirror , I should see my self finding it which means I’ll see where it’s hidden !\\n But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I’m up to ?\\n He tried to edge to the left , to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing , but the ropes around his ankles were too tight : he tripped and fell over .\\n Quirrell ignored him .\\n He was still talking to himself .\\n “ What does this mirror do ?\\n How does it work ?\\n Help me , Master ! ”\\n And to Harry’s horror , a voice answered , and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself .\\n “ Use the boy Use the boy ” Quirrell rounded on Harry .\\n “ Yes Potter come here . ”\\n He clapped his hands once , and the ropes binding Harry fell off .\\n Harry got slowly to his feet .\\n “ Come here , ” Quirrell repeated .\\n “ Look in the mirror and tell me what you see . ”\\n Harry walked toward him .\\n I must lie , he thought desperately .\\n I must look and lie about what I see , that’s all .\\n Quirrell moved close behind him .\\n Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell’s turban .\\n He closed his eyes , stepped in front of the mirror , and opened them again .\\n He saw his reflection , pale and scared looking at first .\\n But a moment later , the reflection smiled at him .\\n It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood red stone .\\n It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket and as it did so , Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket .\\n Somehow incredibly he’d gotten the Stone .\\n “ Well ? ”\\n said Quirrell impatiently .\\n “ What do you see ? ”\\n Harry screwed up his courage .\\n “ I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore , ” he invented .\\n “ I I’ve won the House Cup for Gryffindor . ”\\n Quirrell cursed again .\\n “ Get out of the way , ” he said .\\n As Harry moved aside , he felt the Sorcerer’s Stone against his leg .\\n Dare he make a break for it ?\\n But he hadn’t walked five paces before a high voice spoke , though Quirrell wasn’t moving his lips .\\n “ He lies He lies ” “ Potter , come back here ! ”\\n Quirrell shouted .\\n “ Tell me the truth !\\n What did you just see ? ”\\n The high voice spoke again .\\n “ Let me speak to him face to face . ”\\n “ Master , you are not strong enough ! ”\\n “ I have strength enough for this . ”\\n Harry felt as if Devil’s Snare was rooting him to the spot .\\n He couldn’t move a muscle .\\n Petrified , he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban .\\n What was going on ?\\n The turban fell away .\\n Quirrell’s head looked strangely small without it .\\n Then he turned slowly on the spot .\\n Harry would have screamed , but he couldn’t make a sound .\\n Where there should have been a back to Quirrell’s head , there was a face , the most terrible face Harry had ever seen .\\n It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils , like a snake .\\n “ Harry Potter ” it whispered .\\n Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn’t move .\\n “ See what I have become ? ”\\n the face said .\\n “ Mere shadow and vapor I have form only when I can share another’s body but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds .\\n Unicorn blood has strengthened me , these past weeks you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest and once I have the Elixir of Life , I will be able to create a body of my own .\\n Now why don’t you give me that Stone in your pocket ? ”\\n So he knew .\\n The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry’s legs .\\n He stumbled backward .\\n “ Don’t be a fool , ” snarled the face .\\n “ Better save your own life and join me or you’ll meet the same end as your parents .\\n They died begging me for mercy . ”\\n “ LIAR ! ”\\n Harry shouted suddenly .\\n Quirrell was walking backward at him , so that Voldemort could still see him .\\n The evil face was now smiling .\\n “ How touching ” it hissed .\\n “ I always value bravery .\\n Yes , boy , your parents were brave .\\n I killed your father first , and he put up a courageous fight but your mother needn’t have died she was trying to protect you .\\n Now give me the Stone , unless you want her to have died in vain . ”\\n “ NEVER ! ”\\n Harry sprang toward the flame door , but Voldemort screamed “ SEIZE HIM ! ”\\n and the next second , Harry felt Quirrell’s hand close on his wrist .\\n At once , a needle sharp pain seared across Harry’s scar his head felt as though it was about to split in two he yelled , struggling with all his might , and to his surprise , Quirrell let go of him .\\n The pain in his head lessened he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone , and saw him hunched in pain , looking at his fingers they were blistering before his eyes .\\n “ Seize him !\\n SEIZE HIM ! ”\\n shrieked Voldemort again , and Quirrell lunged , knocking Harry clean off his feet , landing on top of him , both hands around Harry’s neck Harry’s scar was almost blinding him with pain , yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony .\\n “ Master , I cannot hold him my hands my hands ! ”\\n And Quirrell , though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees , let go of his neck and stared , bewildered , at his own palms Harry could see they looked burned , raw , red , and shiny .\\n “ Then kill him , fool , and be done ! ”\\n screeched Voldemort .\\n Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse , but Harry , by instinct , reached up and grabbed Quirrell’s face “ AAAARGH ! ”\\n Quirrell rolled off him , his face blistering , too , and then Harry knew : Quirrell couldn’t touch his bare skin , not without suffering terrible pain his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell , keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse .\\n Harry jumped to his feet , caught Quirrell by the arm , and hung on as tight as he could .\\n Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off the pain in Harry’s head was building he couldn’t see he could only hear Quirrell’s terrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells of , “ KILL HIM !\\n KILL HIM ! ”\\n and other voices , maybe in Harry’s own head , crying , “ Harry !\\n Harry ! ”\\n He felt Quirrell’s arm wrenched from his grasp , knew all was lost , and fell into blackness , down down down Something gold was glinting just above him .\\n The Snitch !\\n He tried to catch it , but his arms were too heavy .\\n He blinked .\\n It wasn’t the Snitch at all .\\n It was a pair of glasses .\\n How strange .\\n He blinked again .\\n The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him .\\n “ Good afternoon , Harry , ” said Dumbledore .\\n Harry stared at him .\\n Then he remembered : “ Sir !\\n The Stone !\\n It was Quirrell !\\n He’s got the Stone !\\n Sir , quick “ Calm yourself , dear boy , you are a little behind the times , ” said Dumbledore .\\n “ Quirrell does not have the Stone . ”\\n “ Then who does ?\\n Sir , I ” “ Harry , please relax , or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out . ”\\n Harry swallowed and looked around him .\\n He realized he must be in the hospital wing .\\n He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets , and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop .\\n “ Tokens from your friends and admirers , ” said Dumbledore , beaming .\\n “ What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret , so , naturally , the whole school knows .\\n I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat .\\n No doubt they thought it would amuse you .\\n Madam Pomfrey , however , felt it might not be very hygienic , and confiscated it . ”\\n “ How long have I been in here ? ”\\n “ Three days .\\n Mr Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round , they have been extremely worried . ”\\n “ But sir , the Stone ” “ I see you are not to be distracted .\\n Very well , the Stone .\\n Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you .\\n I arrived in time to prevent that , although you were doing very well on your own , I must say . ”\\n “ You got there ?\\n You got Hermione’s owl ? ”\\n “ We must have crossed in midair .\\n No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left .\\n I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you ” “ It was you . ”\\n “ I feared I might be too late . ”\\n “ You nearly were , I couldn’t have kept him off the Stone much longer ” “ Not the Stone , boy , you the effort involved nearly killed you .\\n For one terrible moment there , I was afraid it had .\\n As for the Stone , it has been destroyed . ”\\n “ Destroyed ? ”\\n said Harry blankly .\\n “ But your friend Nicolas Flamel ” “ Oh , you know about Nicolas ? ”\\n said Dumbledore , sounding quite delighted .\\n “ You did do the thing properly , didn’t you ?\\n Well , Nicolas and I have had a little chat , and agreed it’s all for the best . ”\\n “ But that means he and his wife will die , won’t they ? ”\\n “ They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then , yes , they will die . ”\\n Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry’s face .\\n “ To one as young as you , I’m sure it seems incredible , but to Nicolas and Perenelle , it really is like going to bed after a very , very long day .\\n After all , to the well organized mind , death is but the next great adventure .\\n You know , the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing .\\n As much money and life as you could want !\\n The two things most human beings would choose above all the trouble is , humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them . ”\\n Harry lay there , lost for words .\\n Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling .\\n “ Sir ? ”\\n said Harry .\\n “ I’ve been thinking Sir even if the Stone’s gone , Vol , I mean , You Know Who ” “ Call him Voldemort , Harry .\\n Always use the proper name for things .\\n Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself . ”\\n “ Yes , sir .\\n Well , Voldemort’s going to try other ways of coming back , isn’t he ?\\n I mean , he hasn’t gone , has he ? ”\\n “ No , Harry , he has not .\\n He is still out there somewhere , perhaps looking for another body to share not being truly alive , he cannot be killed .\\n He left Quirrell to die he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies .\\n Nevertheless , Harry , while you may only have delayed his return to power , it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time and if he is delayed again , and again , why , he may never return to power . ”\\n Harry nodded , but stopped quickly , because it made his head hurt .\\n Then he said , “ Sir , there are some other things I’d like to know , if you can tell me things I want to know the truth about . ”\\n “ The truth . ”\\n Dumbledore sighed .\\n “ It is a beautiful and terrible thing , and should therefore be treated with great caution .\\n However , I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to , in which case I beg you 11 forgive me .\\n I shall not , of course , lie . ”\\n “ Well Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me .\\n But why would he want to kill me in the first place ? ”\\n Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time .\\n “ Alas , the first thing you ask me , I cannot tell you .\\n Not today .\\n Not now .\\n You will know , one day put it from your mind for now , Harry .\\n When you are older I know you hate to hear this when you are ready , you will know . ”\\n And Harry knew it would be no good to argue .\\n “ But why couldn’t Quirrell touch me ? ”\\n “ Your mother died to save you .\\n If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand , it is love .\\n He didn’t realize that love as powerful as your mother’s for you leaves its own mark .\\n Not a scar , no visible sign to have been loved so deeply , even though the person who loved us is gone , will give us some protection forever .\\n It is in your very skin .\\n Quirrell , full of hatred , greed , and ambition , sharing his soul with Voldemort , could not touch you for this reason .\\n It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good . ”\\n Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill , which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet .\\n When he had found his voice again , Harry said , “ And the Invisibility Cloak do you know who sent it to me ? ”\\n “ Ah your father happened to leave it in my possession , and I thought you might like it . ”\\n Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled .\\n “ Useful things your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here . ”\\n “ And there’s something else ” “ Fire away . ”\\n “ Quirrell said Snape ” “ Professor Snape , Harry . ”\\n “ Yes , him Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father .\\n Is that true ? ”\\n “ Well , they did rather detest each other .\\n Not unlike yourself and Mr Malfoy .\\n And then , your father did something Snape could never forgive . ”\\n “ What ? ”\\n “ He saved his life . ”\\n “ What ? ”\\n “ Yes ” said Dumbledore dreamily .\\n “ Funny , the way people’s minds work , isn’t it ?\\n Professor Snape couldn’t bear being in your father’s debt .\\n I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even .\\n Then he could go back to hating your father’s memory in peace . ”\\n Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound , so he stopped .\\n “ And sir , there’s one more thing ” “ Just the one ? ”\\n “ How did I get the Stone out of the mirror ? ”\\n “ Ah , now , I’m glad you asked me that .\\n It was one of my more brilliant ideas , and between you and me , that’s saying something .\\n You see , only one who wanted to find the Stone find it , but not use it would be able to get it , otherwise they’d just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life .\\n My brain surprises even me sometimes .\\n Now , enough questions .\\n I suggest you make a start on these sweets .\\n Ah !\\n Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans !\\n I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one , and since then I’m afraid I’ve rather lost my liking for them but I think I’ll be safe with a nice toffee , don’t you ? ”\\n He smiled and popped the golden brown bean into his mouth .\\n Then he choked and said , “ Alas !\\n Ear wax ! ”\\n Madam Pomfrey , the nurse , was a nice woman , but very strict .\\n “ Just five minutes , ” Harry pleaded .\\n “ Absolutely not . ”\\n “ You let Professor Dumbledore in . ”\\n “ Well , of course , that was the headmaster , quite different .\\n You need rest . ”\\n “ I am resting , look , lying down and everything .\\n Oh , go on , Madam Pomfrey ” “ Oh , very well , ” she said .\\n “ But five minutes only . ”\\n And she let Ron and Hermione in .\\n “ Harryl ” Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again , but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore .\\n “ Oh , Harry , we were sure you were going to Dumbledore was so worried ” “ The whole school’s talking about it , ” said Ron .\\n “ What really happened ? ”\\n It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors .\\n Harry told them everything : Quirrell the mirror the Stone and Voldemort .\\n Ron and Hermione were a very good audience they gasped in all the right places , and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell’s turban , Hermione screamed out loud .\\n “ So the Stone’s gone ? ”\\n said Ron finally .\\n “ Flamel’s just going to die ? ”\\n “ That’s what I said , but Dumbledore thinks that what was it ?\\n ‘ to the well organized mind , death is but the next great adventure . ’ ”\\n “ I always said he was off his rocker , ” said Ron , looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was .\\n “ So what happened to you two ? ”\\n said Harry .\\n “ Well , I got back all right , ” said Hermione .\\n “ I brought Ron round that took a while and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall he already knew he just said , ‘ Harry’s gone after him , hasn’t he ? ’\\n and hurtled off to the third floor . ”\\n “ D’you think he meant you to do it ? ”\\n said Ron .\\n “ Sending you your fathers cloak and everything ? ”\\n “ Well , ” Hermione exploded , “ if he did I mean to say that’s terrible you could have been killed . ”\\n “ No , it isn’t , ” said Harry thoughtfully .\\n “ He’s a funny man , Dumbledore .\\n I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance .\\n I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here , you know .\\n I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try , and instead of stopping us , he just taught us enough to help .\\n I don’t think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked .\\n It’s almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could . ”\\n “ Yeah , Dumbledore’s off his rocker , all right , ” said Ron proudly .\\n “ Listen , you’ve got to be up for the end of year feast tomorrow .\\n The points are all in and Slytherin won , of course you missed the last Quidditch match , we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you but the food’ll be good . ”\\n At that moment , Madam Pomfrey bustled over .\\n “ You’ve had nearly fifteen minutes , now OUT , ” she said firmly .\\n After a good night’s sleep , Harry felt nearly back to normal .\\n “ I want to go to the feast , ” he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes .\\n “ I can , can’t I ? ”\\n “ Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go , ” she said sniffily , as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn’t realize how risky feasts could be .\\n “ And you have another visitor . ”\\n “ Oh , good , ” said Harry .\\n “ Who is it ? ”\\n Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke .\\n As usual when he was indoors , Hagrid looked too big to be allowed .\\n He sat down next to Harry , took one look at him , and burst into tears .\\n “ It’s all my ruddy fault ! ”\\n he sobbed , his face in his hands .\\n “ I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy !\\n I told him !\\n It was the only thing he didn’t know , an ’ I told him !\\n Yeh could’ve died !\\n All fer a dragon egg !\\n I’ll never drink again !\\n I should be chucked out an ’ made ter live as a Muggle ! ”\\n “ Hagrid ! ”\\n said Harry , shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse , great tears leaking down into his beard .\\n “ Hagrid , he’d have found out somehow , this is Voldemort we’re talking about , he’d have found out even if you hadn’t told him . ”\\n “ Yeh could’ve died ! ”\\n sobbed Hagrid .\\n “ An ’ don ’ say the name ! ”\\n “ VOLDEMORT ! ”\\n Harry bellowed , and Hagrid was so shocked , he stopped crying .\\n “ I’ve met him and I’m calling him by his name .\\n Please cheer up , Hagrid , we saved the Stone , it’s gone , he can’t use it .\\n Have a Chocolate Frog , I’ve got loads . ”\\n Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said , “ That reminds me .\\n I’ve got yeh a present . ”\\n “ It’s not a stoat sandwich , is it ? ”\\n said Harry anxiously , and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle .\\n “ Nah .\\n Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it .\\n ’ Course , he shoulda sacked me instead anyway , got y eh this ” It seemed to be a handsome , leather covered book .\\n Harry opened it curiously .\\n It was full of wizard photographs .\\n Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father .\\n “ Sent owls off ter all yer parents ’ old school friends , askin ’ fer photos knew yeh didn ’ have any d’yeh like it ? ”\\n Harry couldn’t speak , but Hagrid understood .\\n Harry made his way down to the end of year feast alone that night .\\n He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey’s fussing about , insisting on giving him one last checkup , so the Great Hall was already full .\\n It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin ’ s winning the House Cup for the seventh year in a row .\\n A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table .\\n When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush , and then everybody started talking loudly at once .\\n He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him .\\n Fortunately , Dumbledore arrived moments later .\\n The babble died away .\\n “ Another year gone ! ”\\n Dumbledore said cheerfully .\\n “ And I must trouble you with an old man’s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast .\\n What a year it has been !\\n Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts .\\n “ Now , as I understand it , the House Cup here needs awarding , and the points stand thus : In fourth place , Gryffindor , with three hundred and twelve points in third , Hufflepuff , with three hundred and fifty two Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty six and Slytherin , four hundred and seventy two . ”\\n A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table .\\n Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table .\\n It was a sickening sight .\\n “ Yes , yes , well done , Slytherin , ” said Dumbledore .\\n “ However , recent events must be taken into account . ”\\n The room went very still .\\n The Slytherins ’ smiles faded a little .\\n “ Ahem , ” said Dumbledore .\\n “ I have a few last minute points to dish out .\\n Let me see .\\n Yes “ First to Mr Ronald Weasley ” Ron went purple in the face he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn . “\\n for the best played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years , I award Gryffindor House fifty points . ”\\n Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling the stars overhead seemed to quiver .\\n Percy could be heard telling the other prefects , “ My brother , you know !\\n My youngest brother !\\n Got past McGonagall’s giant chess set ! ”\\n At last there was silence again .\\n “ Second to Miss Hermione Granger for the use of cool logic in the face of fire , I award Gryffindor House fifty points . ”\\n Hermione buried her face in her arms Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears .\\n Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves they were a hundred points up .\\n “ Third to Mr Harry Potter ” said Dumbledore .\\n The room went deadly quiet . “\\n for pure nerve and outstanding courage , I award Gryffindor House sixty points . ”\\n The din was deafening .\\n Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy two points exactly the same as Slytherin .\\n They had tied for the House Cup if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point .\\n Dumbledore raised his hand .\\n The room gradually fell silent .\\n “ There are all kinds of courage , ” said Dumbledore , smiling .\\n “ It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies , but just as much to stand up to our friends .\\n I therefore award ten points to Mr Neville Longbottom . ”\\n Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place , so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table .\\n Harry , Ron , and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville , white with shock , disappeared under a pile of people hugging him .\\n He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before .\\n Harry , still cheering , nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy , who couldn’t have looked more stunned and horrified if he’d just had the Body Bind Curse put on him .\\n “ Which means , ” Dumbledore called over the storm of applause , for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin , “ we need a little change of decoration . ”\\n He clapped his hands .\\n In an instant , the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place .\\n Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall’s hand , with a horrible , forced smile .\\n He caught Harry’s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape ’ s feelings toward him hadn’t changed one jot .\\n This didn’t worry Harry .\\n It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year , or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts .\\n It was the best evening of Harry’s life , better than winning at Quidditch , or Christmas , or knocking out mountain trolls he would never , ever forget tonight .\\n Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come , but come they did .\\n To their great surprise , both he and Ron passed with good marks Hermione , of course , had the best grades of the first years .\\n Even Neville scraped through , his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one .\\n They had hoped that Goyle , who was almost as stupid as he was mean , might be thrown out , but he had passed , too .\\n It was a shame , but as Ron said , you couldn’t have everything in life .\\n And suddenly , their wardrobes were empty , their trunks were packed , Neville’s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets notes were handed out to all students , warning them not to use magic over the holidays ( “ I always hope they’ll forget to give us these , ” said Fred Weasley sadly ) Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake they were boarding the Hogwarts Express talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats pulling into platform nine and three quarters at King’s Cross station .\\n It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform .\\n A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier , letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn’t attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles .\\n “ You must come and stay this summer , ” said Ron , “ both of you I’ll send you an owl . ”\\n “ Thanks , ” said Harry , “ I’ll need something to look forward to . ”\\n People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world .\\n Some of them called : “ Bye , Harry ! ”\\n “ See you , Potter ! ”\\n “ Still famous , ” said Ron , grinning at him .\\n “ Not where I’m going , I promise you , ” said Harry .\\n He , Ron , and Hermione passed through the gateway together .\\n “ There he is , Mom , there he is , look ! ”\\n It was Ginny Weasley , Ron’s younger sister , but she wasn’t pointing at Ron .\\n “ Harry Potter ! ”\\n she squealed .\\n “ Look , Mom !\\n I can see “ Be quiet , Ginny , and it’s rude to point . ”\\n Mrs Weasley smiled down at them .\\n “ Busy year ? ”\\n she said .\\n “ Very , ” said Harry .\\n “ Thanks for the fudge and the sweater , Mrs Weasley . ”\\n “ Oh , it was nothing , dear . ”\\n “ Ready , are you ? ”\\n It was Uncle Vernon , still purple faced , still mustached , still looking furious at the nerve of Harry , carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people .\\n Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley , looking terrified at the very sight of Harry .\\n “ You must be Harry’s family ! ”\\n said Mrs Weasley .\\n “ In a manner of speaking , ” said Uncle Vernon .\\n “ Hurry up , boy , we haven’t got all day . ”\\n He walked away .\\n Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione .\\n “ See you over the summer , then . ”\\n “ Hope you have er a good holiday , ” said Hermione , looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon , shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant .\\n “ Oh , I will , ” said Harry , and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face .\\n “ They don’t know we’re not allowed to use magic at home .\\n I’m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer ”',\n",
       "   'Chapter : THE SORTING HAT .\\n The door swung open at once .\\n A tall , black haired witch in emerald green robes stood there .\\n She had a very stern face and Harry’s first thought was that this was not someone to cross .\\n “ The firs ’ years , Professor McGonagall , ” said Hagrid .\\n “ Thank you , Hagrid .\\n I will take them from here . ”\\n She pulled the door wide .\\n The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys ’ house in it .\\n The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts , the ceiling was too high to make out , and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors .\\n They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor .\\n Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right the rest of the school must already be here but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small , empty chamber off the hall .\\n They crowded in , standing rather closer together than they would usually have done , peering about nervously .\\n “ Welcome to Hogwarts , ” said Professor McGonagall .\\n “ The start of term banquet will begin shortly , but before you take your seats in the Great Hall , you will be sorted into your Houses .\\n The Sorting is a very important ceremony because , while you are here , your House will be something like your family within Hogwarts .\\n You will have classes with the rest of your House , sleep in your House dormitory , and spend free time in your House common room .\\n “ The four Houses are called Gryffindor , Hufflepuff , Ravenclaw , and Slytherin .\\n Each House has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards .\\n While you are at Hogwarts , your triumphs will earn your House points , while any rule breaking will lose House points .\\n At the end of the year , the House with the most points is awarded the House cup , a great honor .\\n I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours .\\n “ The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school .\\n I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting . ”\\n Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak , which was fastened under his left ear , and on Ron’s smudged nose .\\n Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair .\\n “ I shall return when we are ready for you , ” said Professor McGonagall .\\n “ Please wait quietly . ”\\n She left the chamber .\\n Harry swallowed .\\n “ How exactly do they sort us into Houses ? ”\\n he asked Ron .\\n “ Some sort of test , I think .\\n Fred said it hurts a lot , but I think he was joking . ”\\n Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt .\\n A test ?\\n In front of the whole school ?\\n But he didn’t know any magic yet what on earth would he have to do ?\\n He hadn’t expected something like this the moment they arrived .\\n He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified , too .\\n No one was talking much except Hermione Granger , who was whispering very fast about all the spells she’d learned and wondering which one she’d need .\\n Harry tried hard not to listen to her .\\n He’d never been more nervous , never , not even when he’d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he’d somehow turned his teachers wig blue .\\n He kept his eyes fixed on the door .\\n Any second now , Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom .\\n Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air several people behind him screamed .\\n “ What the ? ”\\n He gasped .\\n So did the people around him .\\n About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall .\\n Pearly white and slightly transparent , they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years .\\n They seemed to be arguing .\\n What looked like a fat little monk was saying : “ Forgive and forget , I say , we ought to give him a second chance ” “ My dear Friar , haven’t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves ?\\n He gives us all a bad name and you know , he’s not really even a ghost I say , what are you all doing here ? ”\\n A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years .\\n Nobody answered .\\n “ New students ! ”\\n said the Fat Friar , smiling around at them .\\n “ About to be Sorted , I suppose ? ”\\n A few people nodded mutely .\\n “ Hope to see you in Hufflepuff ! ”\\n said the Friar .\\n “ My old House , you know . ”\\n “ Move along now , ” said a sharp voice .\\n “ The Sorting Ceremony’s about to start . ”\\n Professor McGonagall had returned .\\n One by one , the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall .\\n “ Now , form a line , ” Professor McGonagall told the first years , “ and follow me . ”\\n Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead , Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair , with Ron behind him , and they walked out of the chamber , back across the hall , and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall .\\n Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place .\\n It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables , where the rest of the students were sitting .\\n These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets .\\n At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting .\\n Professor McGonagall led the first years up here , so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students , with the teachers behind them .\\n The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight .\\n Dotted here and there among the students , the ghosts shone misty silver .\\n Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes , Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars .\\n He heard Hermione whisper , “ It’s bewitched to look like the sky outside .\\n I read about it in Hogwarts , A History . ”\\n It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all , and that the Great Hall didn’t simply open on to the heavens .\\n Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four legged stool in front of the first years .\\n On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard’s hat .\\n This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty .\\n Aunt Petunia wouldn’t have let it in the house .\\n Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it , Harry thought wildly , that seemed the sort of thing noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat , he stared at it , too .\\n For a few seconds , there was complete silence .\\n Then the hat twitched .\\n A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth and the hat began to sing : “ Oh , you may not think I’m pretty , But don’t judge on what you see , I’ll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me .\\n You can keep your bowlers black , Your top hats sleek and tall , For I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can cap them all .\\n There’s nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can’t see , So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be .\\n You might belong in Gryffindor , Where dwell the brave at heart , Their daring , nerve , and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart You might belong in Hufflepuff , Where they are just and loyal , Those patient Hufflepuffs are true And unafraid of toil Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw , If you’ve a ready mind , Where those of wit and learning , Will always find their kind Or perhaps in Slytherin You’ll make your real friends , Those cunning folk use any means To achieve their ends .\\n So put me on !\\n Don’t be afraid l And don’t get in a flap You’re in safe hands ( though I have none ) For I’m a Thinking Cap ” The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song .\\n It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again .\\n “ So we’ve just got to try on the hat ! ”\\n Ron whispered to Harry .\\n “ I’ll kill Fred , he was going on about wrestling a troll . ”\\n Harry smiled weakly .\\n Yes , trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell , but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching .\\n The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot Harry didn’t feel brave or quick witted or any of it at the moment .\\n If only the hat had mentioned a House for people who felt a bit queasy , that would have been the one for him .\\n Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment .\\n “ When I call your name , you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted , ” she said .\\n “ Abbott , Hannah ! ”\\n A pink faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line , put on the hat , which fell right down over her eyes , and sat down .\\n A moment’s pause “ HUFFLEPUFF ! ”\\n shouted the hat .\\n The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table .\\n Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her .\\n “ Bones , Susan ! ”\\n “ HUFFLEPUFF ! ”\\n shouted the hat again , and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah .\\n “ Boot , Terry ! ”\\n “ RAVENCLAW ! ”\\n The table second from the left clapped this time several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them .\\n “ Brocklehurst , Mandy ” went to Ravenclaw too , but “ Brown , Lavender ” became the first new Gryffindor , and the table on the far left exploded with cheers Harry could see Ron’s twin brothers catcalling .\\n “ Bulstrode , Millicent ” then became a Slytherin .\\n Perhaps it was Harry’s imagination , after all he’d heard about Slytherin , but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot .\\n He was starting to feel definitely sick now .\\n He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school .\\n He had always been last to be chosen , not because he was no good , but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him .\\n “ Finch Fletchley , Justin ! ”\\n “ HUFFLEPUFF ! ”\\n Sometimes , Harry noticed , the hat shouted out the House at once , but at others it took a little while to decide .\\n “ Finnigan , Seamus , ” the sandy haired boy next to Harry in the line , sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor .\\n “ Granger , Hermione ! ”\\n Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head .\\n “ GRYFFINDOR ! ”\\n shouted the hat .\\n Ron groaned .\\n A horrible thought struck Harry , as horrible thoughts always do when you’re very nervous .\\n What if he wasn’t chosen at all ?\\n What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages , until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he’d better get back on the train ?\\n When Neville Longbottom , the boy who kept losing his toad , was called , he fell over on his way to the stool .\\n The hat took a long time to decide with Neville .\\n When it finally shouted , “ GRYFFINDOR , ” Neville ran off still wearing it , and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to “ MacDougal , Morag . ”\\n Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once : the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed , “ SLYTHERIN ! ”\\n Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle , looking pleased with himself .\\n There weren’t many people left now .\\n “ Moon ” , “ Nott ” , “ Parkinson ” , then a pair of twin girls , “ Path ” and “ Path ” , then “ Perks , Sally Anne ” , and then , at last “ Potter , Harry ! ”\\n As Harry stepped forward , whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall .\\n “ Potter , did she say ? ”\\n “ The Harry Potter ? ”\\n The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him .\\n Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat .\\n He waited .\\n “ Hmm , ” said a small voice in his ear .\\n “ Difficult .\\n Very difficult .\\n Plenty of courage , I see .\\n Not a bad mind either .\\n There’s talent , oh my goodness , yes and a nice thirst to prove yourself , now that’s interesting .\\n So where shall I put you ? ”\\n Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought , Not Slytherin , not Slytherin .\\n “ Not Slytherin , eh ? ”\\n said the small voice .\\n “ Are you sure ?\\n You could be great , you know , it’s all here in your head , and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness , no doubt about that no ?\\n Well , if you’re sure better be GRYFFINDOR ! ”\\n Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall .\\n He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table .\\n He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin , he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet .\\n Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously , while the Weasley twins yelled , “ We got Potter !\\n We got Potter ! ”\\n Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he’d seen earlier .\\n The ghost patted his arm , giving Harry the sudden , horrible feeling he’d just plunged it into a bucket of ice cold water .\\n He could see the High Table properly now .\\n At the end nearest him sat Hagrid , who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up .\\n Harry grinned back .\\n And there , in the center of the High Table , in a large gold chair , sat Albus Dumbledore .\\n Harry recognized him at once from the card he’d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train .\\n Dumbledore’s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts .\\n Harry spotted Professor Quirrell , too , the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron .\\n He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban .\\n And now there were only four people left to be sorted .\\n “ Thomas , Dean , ” a Black boy even taller than Ron , joined Harry at the Gryffindor table .\\n “ Turpin , Lisa , ” became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron’s turn .\\n He was pale green by now .\\n Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted , “ GRYFFINDOR ! ”\\n Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him .\\n “ Well done , Ron , excellent , ” said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as “ Zabini , Blaise , ” was made a Slytherin .\\n Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away .\\n Harry looked down at his empty gold plate .\\n He had only just realized how hungry he was .\\n The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago .\\n Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet .\\n He was beaming at the students , his arms opened wide , as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there .\\n “ Welcome ! ”\\n he said .\\n “ Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts !\\n Before we begin our banquet , I would like to say a few words .\\n And here they are : Nitwit !\\n Blubber !\\n Oddment !\\n Tweak !\\n “ Thank you ! ”\\n He sat back down .\\n Everybody clapped and cheered .\\n Harry didn’t know whether to laugh or not .\\n “ Is he a bit mad ? ”\\n he asked Percy uncertainly .\\n “ Mad ? ”\\n said Percy airily .\\n “ He’s a genius !\\n Best wizard in the world !\\n But he is a bit mad , yes .\\n Potatoes , Harry ? ”\\n Harry’s mouth fell open .\\n The dishes in front of him were now piled with food .\\n He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table : roast beef , roast chicken , pork chops and lamb chops , sausages , bacon and steak , boiled potatoes , roast potatoes , fries , Yorkshire pudding , peas , carrots , gravy , ketchup , and , for some strange reason , peppermint humbugs .\\n The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry , but he’d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked .\\n Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted , even if it made him sick .\\n Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat .\\n It was all delicious .\\n “ That does look good , ” said the ghost in the ruff sadly , watching Harry cut up his steak .\\n “ Can’t you ? ”\\n “ I haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years , ” said the ghost .\\n “ I don’t need to , of course , but one does miss it .\\n I don’t think I’ve introduced myself ?\\n Sir Nicholas de Mimsy Porpington at your service .\\n Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower . ”\\n “ I know who you are ! ”\\n said Ron suddenly .\\n “ My brothers told me about you you’re Nearly Headless Nick ! ”\\n “ I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy ” the ghost began stiffly , but sandy haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted .\\n “ Nearly Headless ?\\n How can you be nearly headless ? ”\\n Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed , as if their little chat wasn’t going at all the way he wanted .\\n “ Like this , ” he said irritably .\\n He seized his left ear and pulled .\\n His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge .\\n Someone had obviously tried to behead him , but not done it properly .\\n Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces , Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck , coughed , and said , “ So new Gryffindors !\\n I hope you’re going to help us win the House Championship this year ?\\n Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning .\\n Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row !\\n The Bloody Baron’s becoming almost unbearable he’s the Slytherin ghost . ”\\n Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there , with blank staring eyes , a gaunt face , and robes stained with silver blood .\\n He was right next to Malfoy who , Harry was pleased to see , didn’t look too pleased with the seating arrangements .\\n “ How did he get covered in blood ? ”\\n asked Seamus with great interest .\\n “ I’ve never asked , ” said Nearly Headless Nick delicately .\\n When everyone had eaten as much as they could , the remains of the food faded from the plates , leaving them sparkling clean as before .\\n A moment later the desserts appeared .\\n Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of , apple pies , treacle tarts , chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts , trifle , strawberries , Jell 0 , rice pudding As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart , the talk turned to their families .\\n “ I’m half and half , ” said Seamus .\\n “ Me dad’s a Muggle .\\n Mom didn’t tell him she was a witch ’ til after they were married .\\n Bit of a nasty shock for him . ”\\n The others laughed .\\n “ What about you , Neville ? ”\\n said Ron .\\n “ Well , my gran brought me up and she’s a witch , ” said Neville , “ but the family thought I was all Muggle for ages .\\n My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once , I nearly drowned but nothing happened until I was eight .\\n Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner , and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go .\\n But I bounced all the way down the garden and into the road .\\n They were all really pleased , Gran was crying , she was so happy .\\n And you should have seen their faces when I got in here they thought I might not be magic enough to come , you see .\\n Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad . ”\\n On Harry’s other side , Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons ( “ I do hope they start right away , there’s so much to learn , I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration , you know , turning something into something else , of course , it’s supposed to be very difficult “ You’ll be starting small , just matches into needles and that sort of thing ” ) .\\n Harry , who was starting to feel warm and sleepy , looked up at the High Table again .\\n Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet .\\n Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore .\\n Professor Quirrell , in his absurd turban , was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair , a hooked nose , and sallow skin .\\n It happened very suddenly .\\n The hook nosed teacher looked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes and a sharp , hot pain shot across the scar on Harry’s forehead .\\n “ Ouch ! ”\\n Harry clapped a hand to his head .\\n “ What is it ? ”\\n asked Percy .\\n “ N nothing . ”\\n The pain had gone as quickly as it had come .\\n Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher’s look a feeling that he didn’t like Harry at all .\\n “ Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell ? ”\\n he asked Percy .\\n “ Oh , you know Quirrell already , do you ?\\n No wonder he’s looking so nervous , that’s Professor Snape .\\n He teaches Potions , but he doesn’t want to everyone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job .\\n Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts , Snape . ”\\n Harry watched Snape for a while , but Snape didn’t look at him again .\\n At last , the desserts too disappeared , and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again .\\n The hall fell silent .\\n “ Ahem just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered .\\n I have a few start of term notices to give you .\\n “ First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils .\\n And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well . ”\\n Dumbledore ’ s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins .\\n “ I have also been asked by Mr Filch , the caretaker , to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors .\\n “ Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term .\\n Anyone interested in playing for their House teams should contact Madam Hooch .\\n “ And finally , I must tell you that this year , the third floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death . ”\\n Harry laughed , but he was one of the few who did .\\n “ He’s not serious ? ”\\n he muttered to Percy .\\n “ Must be , ” said Percy , frowning at Dumbledore .\\n “ It’s odd , because he usually gives us a reason why we’re not allowed to go somewhere the forest’s full of dangerous beasts , everyone knows that .\\n I do think he might have told us prefects , at least . ”\\n “ And now , before we go to bed , let us sing the school song ! ”\\n cried Dumbledore .\\n Harry noticed that the other teachers ’ smiles had become rather fixed .\\n Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick , as if he was trying to get a fly off the end , and a long golden ribbon flew out of it , which rose high above the tables and twisted itself , snakelike , into words .\\n “ Everyone pick their favorite tune , ” said Dumbledore , “ and off we go ! ”\\n And the school bellowed : “ Hogwarts , Hogwarts , Hoggy Warty Hogwarts , Teach us something please , Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees , Our heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff , For now they’re bare and full of air , Dead flies and bits of fluff , So teach us things worth knowing , Bring back what we’ve forgot , Just do your best , we’ll do the rest , And learn until our brains all rot . ”\\n Everybody finished the song at different times .\\n At last , only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march .\\n Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished , he was one of those who clapped loudest .\\n “ Ah , music , ” he said , wiping his eyes .\\n “ A magic beyond all we do here !\\n And now , bedtime .\\n Off you trot ! ”\\n The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds , out of the Great Hall , and up the marble staircase .\\n Harry’s legs were like lead again , but only because he was so tired and full of food .\\n He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed , or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries .\\n They climbed more staircases , yawning and dragging their feet , and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt .\\n A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them , and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him .\\n “ Peeves , ” Percy whispered to the first years .\\n “ A poltergeist . ”\\n He raised his voice , “ Peeves show yourself . ”\\n A loud , rude sound , like the air being let out of a balloon , answered .\\n “ Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron ? ”\\n There was a pop , and a little man with wicked , dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared , floating cross legged in the air , clutching the walking sticks .\\n “ Oooooooh ! ”\\n he said , with an evil cackle .\\n “ Ickle Firsties !\\n What fun ! ”\\n He swooped suddenly at them .\\n They all ducked .\\n “ Go away , Peeves , or the Baron’ll hear about this , I mean it ! ”\\n barked Percy .\\n Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished , dropping the walking sticks on Neville’s head .\\n They heard him zooming away , rattling coats of armor as he passed .\\n “ You want to watch out for Peeves , ” said Percy , as they set off again .\\n “ The Bloody Baron’s the only one who can control him , he won’t even listen to us prefects .\\n Here we are . ”\\n At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress .\\n “ Password ? ”\\n she said .\\n “ Caput Draconis , ” said Percy , and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall .\\n They all scrambled through it Neville needed a leg up and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room , a cozy , round room full of squashy armchairs .\\n Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another .\\n At the top of a spiral staircase they were obviously in one of the towers they found their beds at last : five four posters hung with deep red , velvet curtains .\\n Their trunks had already been brought up .\\n Too tired to talk much , they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed .\\n “ Great food , isn’t it ? ”\\n Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings .\\n “ Get off Scabbers !\\n He’s chewing my sheets . ”\\n Harry was going to ask Ron if he’d had any of the treacle tart , but he fell asleep almost at once .\\n Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much , because he had a very strange dream .\\n He was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban , which kept talking to him , telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once , because it was his destiny .\\n Harry told the turban he didn’t want to be in Slytherin it got heavier and heavier he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully and there was Malfoy , laughing at him as he struggled with it then Malfoy turned into the hook nosed teacher , Snape , whose laugh became high and cold there was a burst of green light and Harry woke , sweating and shaking .\\n He rolled over and fell asleep again , and when he woke next day , he didn’t remember the dream at all .',\n",
       "   'Chapter : THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE QUARTERS .\\n Harry’s last month with the Dursleys wasn’t fun .\\n True , Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn’t stay in the same room , while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn’t shut Harry in his cupboard , force him to do anything , or shout at him in fact , they didn’t speak to him at all .\\n Half terrified , half furious , they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty .\\n Although this was an improvement in many ways , it did become a bit depressing after a while .\\n Harry kept to his room , with his new owl for company .\\n He had decided to call her Hedwig , a name he had found in A History of Magic .\\n His school books were very interesting .\\n He lay on his bed reading late into the night , Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased .\\n It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn’t come in to vacuum anymore , because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice .\\n Every night before he went to sleep , Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall , counting down to September the first .\\n On the last day of August he thought he’d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King’s Cross station the next day , so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television .\\n He cleared his throat to let them know he was there , and Dudley screamed and ran from the room .\\n “ Er Uncle Vernon ? ”\\n Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening .\\n “ Er I need to be at King’s Cross tomorrow to to go to Hogwarts . ”\\n Uncle Vernon grunted again .\\n “ Would it be all right if you gave me a lift ? ”\\n Grunt .\\n Harry supposed that meant yes .\\n “ Thank you . ”\\n He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke .\\n “ Funny way to get to a wizards ’ school , the train .\\n Magic carpets all got punctures , have they ? ”\\n Harry didn’t say anything .\\n “ Where is this school , anyway ? ”\\n “ I don’t know , ” said Harry , realizing this for the first time .\\n He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket .\\n “ I just take the train from platform nine and three quarters at eleven o’clock , ” he read .\\n His aunt and uncle stared .\\n “ Platform what ? ”\\n “ Nine and three quarters . ”\\n “ Don’t talk rubbish , ” said Uncle Vernon .\\n “ There is no platform nine and three quarters . ”\\n “ It’s on my ticket . ”\\n “ Barking , ” said Uncle Vernon , “ howling mad , the lot of them .\\n You 11 see .\\n You just wait .\\n All right , we’ll take you to King’s Cross .\\n We’re going up to London tomorrow anyway , or I wouldn’t bother . ”\\n “ Why are you going to London ? ”\\n Harry asked , trying to keep things friendly .\\n “ Taking Dudley to the hospital , ” growled Uncle Vernon .\\n “ Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings . ”\\n Harry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep .\\n He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn’t want to walk into the station in his wizard’s robes he’d change on the train .\\n He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed , saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage , and then paced the room , waiting for the Dursleys to get up .\\n Two hours later , Harry’s huge , heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys ’ car , Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry , and they had set off .\\n They reached King’s Cross at half past ten .\\n Uncle Vernon dumped Harry’s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him .\\n Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead , facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face .\\n “ Well , there you are , boy .\\n Platform nine platform ten .\\n Your platform should be somewhere in the middle , but they don’t seem to have built it yet , do they ? ”\\n He was quite right , of course .\\n There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it , and in the middle , nothing at all .\\n “ Have a good term , ” said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile .\\n He left without another word .\\n Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away .\\n All three of them were laughing .\\n Harry’s mouth went rather dry .\\n What on earth was he going to do ?\\n He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks , because of Hedwig .\\n He’d have to ask someone .\\n He stopped a passing guard , but didn’t dare mention platform nine and three quarters .\\n The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn’t even tell him what part of the country it was in , he started to get annoyed , as though Harry was being stupid on purpose .\\n Getting desperate , Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o’clock , but the guard said there wasn’t one .\\n In the end the guard strode away , muttering about time wasters .\\n Harry was now trying hard not to panic .\\n According to the large clock over the arrivals board , he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift , a pocket full of wizard money , and a large owl .\\n Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do , like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley .\\n He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector’s stand between platforms nine and ten .\\n At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying .\\n “ packed with Muggles , of course ” Harry swung round .\\n The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys , all with flaming red hair .\\n Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry’s in front of him and they had an owl .\\n Heart hammering , Harry pushed his cart after them .\\n They stopped and so did he , just near enough to hear what they were saying .\\n “ Now , what’s the platform number ? ”\\n said the boys ’ mother .\\n “ Nine and three quarters ! ”\\n piped a small girl , also red headed , who was holding her hand , “ Mom , can’t I go “ You’re not old enough , Ginny , now be quiet .\\n All right , Percy , you go first . ”\\n What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten .\\n Harry watched , careful not to blink in case he missed it but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms , a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away , the boy had vanished .\\n “ Fred , you next , ” the plump woman said .\\n “ I’m not Fred , I’m George , ” said the boy .\\n “ Honestly , woman , you call yourself our mother ?\\n Can’t you tell I’m George ? ”\\n “ Sorry , George , dear . ”\\n “ Only joking , I am Fred , ” said the boy , and off he went .\\n His twin called after him to hurry up , and he must have done so , because a second later , he had gone but how had he done it ?\\n Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there and then , quite suddenly , he wasn’t anywhere .\\n There was nothing else for it .\\n “ Excuse me , ” Harry said to the plump woman .\\n “ Hello , dear , ” she said .\\n “ First time at Hogwarts ?\\n Ron’s new , too . ”\\n She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons .\\n He was tall , thin , and gangling , with freckles , big hands and feet , and a long nose .\\n “ Yes , ” said Harry .\\n “ The thing is the thing is , I don’t know how to ” “ How to get onto the platform ? ”\\n she said kindly , and Harry nodded .\\n “ Not to worry , ” she said .\\n “ All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten .\\n Don’t stop and don’t be scared you’ll crash into it , that’s very important .\\n Best do it at a bit of a run if you’re nervous .\\n Go on , go now before Ron . ”\\n “ Er okay , ” said Harry .\\n He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier .\\n It looked very solid .\\n He started to walk toward it .\\n People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten .\\n Harry walked more quickly .\\n He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he’d be in trouble leaning forward on his cart , he broke into a heavy run the barrier was coming nearer and nearer he wouldn’t be able to stop the cart was out of control he was a foot away he closed his eyes ready for the crash It didn’t come he kept on running he opened his eyes .\\n A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people .\\n A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express , eleven o’clock .\\n Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought iron archway where the barrier had been , with the words Platform Nine and Three Quarters on it .\\n He had done it .\\n Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd , while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs .\\n Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks .\\n The first few carriages were already packed with students , some hanging out of the window to talk to their families , some fighting over seats .\\n Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat .\\n He passed a round faced boy who was saying , “ Gran , I’ve lost my toad again . ”\\n “ Oh , Neville , ” he heard the old woman sigh .\\n A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd .\\n “ Give us a look , Lee , go on . ”\\n The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms , and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long , hairy leg .\\n Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train .\\n He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door .\\n He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot .\\n “ Want a hand ? ”\\n It was one of the red haired twins he’d followed through the barrier .\\n “ Yes , please , ” Harry panted .\\n “ Oy , Fred !\\n C’mere and help ! ”\\n With the twins ’ help , Harry’s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment .\\n “ Thanks , ” said Harry , pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes .\\n “ What’s that ? ”\\n said one of the twins suddenly , pointing at Harry’s lightning scar .\\n “ Blimey , ” said the other twin .\\n “ Are you ? ”\\n “ He is , ” said the first twin .\\n “ Aren’t you ? ”\\n he added to Harry .\\n “ What ? ”\\n said Harry .\\n “ Harry Potter , ” chorused the twins .\\n “ Oh , him , ” said Harry .\\n “ I mean , yes , I am . ”\\n The two boys gawked at him , and Harry felt himself turning red .\\n Then , to his relief , a voice came floating in through the train’s open door .\\n “ Fred ?\\n George ?\\n Are you there ? ”\\n “ Coming , Mom . ”\\n With a last look at Harry , the twins hopped off the train .\\n Harry sat down next to the window where , half hidden , he could watch the red haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying .\\n Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief .\\n “ Ron , you’ve got something on your nose . ”\\n The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way , but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose .\\n “ Mom geroff . ”\\n He wriggled free .\\n “ Aaah , has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie ? ”\\n said one of the twins .\\n “ Shut up , ” said Ron .\\n “ Where’s Percy ? ”\\n said their mother .\\n “ He’s coming now . ”\\n The oldest boy came striding into sight .\\n He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes , and Harry noticed a shiny red and gold badge on his chest with the letter P on it .\\n “ Can’t stay long , Mother , ” he said .\\n “ I’m up front , the prefects have got two compartments to themselves ” “ Oh , are you a prefect , Percy ? ”\\n said one of the twins , with an air of great surprise .\\n “ You should have said something , we had no idea . ”\\n “ Hang on , I think I remember him saying something about it , ” said the other twin .\\n “ Once ” “ Or twice ” “ A minute ” “ All summer ” “ Oh , shut up , ” said Percy the Prefect .\\n “ How come Percy gets new robes , anyway ? ”\\n said one of the twins .\\n “ Because he’s a prefect , ” said their mother fondly .\\n “ All right , dear , well , have a good term send me an owl when you get there . ”\\n She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left .\\n Then she turned to the twins .\\n “ Now , you two this year , you behave yourselves .\\n If I get one more owl telling me you’ve you’ve blown up a toilet or ” “ Blown up a toilet ?\\n We’ve never blown up a toilet . ”\\n “ Great idea though , thanks , Mom . ”\\n “ It’s not funny .\\n And look after Ron . ”\\n “ Don’t worry , ickle Ronniekins is safe with us . ”\\n “ Shut up , ” said Ron again .\\n He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it .\\n “ Hey , Mom , guess what ?\\n Guess who we just met on the train ? ”\\n Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn’t see him looking .\\n “ You know that black haired boy who was near us in the station ?\\n Know who he is ? ”\\n “ Who ? ”\\n “ Harry Potted ” Harry heard the little girl’s voice .\\n “ Oh , Mom , can I go on the train and see him , Mom , oh please . ”\\n “ You’ve already seen him , Ginny , and the poor boy isn’t something you goggle at in a zoo .\\n Is he really , Fred ?\\n How do you know ? ”\\n “ Asked him .\\n Saw his scar .\\n It’s really there like lightning . ”\\n “ Poor dear no wonder he was alone , I wondered .\\n He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform . ”\\n “ Never mind that , do you think he remembers what You Know Who looks like ? ”\\n Their mother suddenly became very stern .\\n “ I forbid you to ask him , Fred .\\n No , don’t you dare .\\n As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school . ”\\n “ All right , keep your hair on . ”\\n A whistle sounded .\\n “ Hurry up ! ”\\n their mother said , and the three boys clambered onto the train .\\n They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good bye , and their younger sister began to cry .\\n “ Don’t , Ginny , we’ll send you loads of owls . ”\\n “ Well send you a Hogwarts toilet seat . ”\\n “ Georg e ” “ Only joking , Mom . ”\\n The train began to move .\\n Harry saw the boys ’ mother waving and their sister , half laughing , half crying , running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed , then she fell back and waved .\\n Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner .\\n Houses flashed past the window .\\n Harry felt a great leap of excitement .\\n He didn’t know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind .\\n The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in .\\n “ Anyone sitting there ? ”\\n he asked , pointing at the seat opposite Harry .\\n “ Everywhere else is full . ”\\n Harry shook his head and the boy sat down .\\n He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window , pretending he hadn’t looked .\\n Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose .\\n “ Hey , Ron . ”\\n The twins were back .\\n “ Listen , we’re going down the middle of the train Lee Jordan’s got a giant tarantula down there . ”\\n “ Right , ” mumbled Ron .\\n “ Harry , ” said the other twin , “ did we introduce ourselves ?\\n Fred and George Weasley .\\n And this is Ron , our brother .\\n See you later , then . ”\\n “ Bye , ” said Harry and Ron .\\n The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them .\\n “ Are you really Harry Potter ? ”\\n Ron blurted out .\\n Harry nodded .\\n “ Oh well , I thought it might be one of Fred and George’s jokes , ” said Ron .\\n “ And have you really got you know ” He pointed at Harry’s forehead .\\n Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar .\\n Ron stared .\\n “ So that’s where You Know Who ? ”\\n “ Yes , ” said Harry , “ but I can’t remember it . ”\\n “ Nothing ? ”\\n said Ron eagerly .\\n “ Well I remember a lot of green light , but nothing else . ”\\n “ Wow , ” said Ron .\\n He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments , then , as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing , he looked quickly out of the window again .\\n “ Are all your family wizards ? ”\\n asked Harry , who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him .\\n “ Er yes , I think so , ” said Ron .\\n “ I think Mom’s got a second cousin who’s an accountant , but we never talk about him . ”\\n “ So you must know loads of magic already . ”\\n The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about .\\n “ I heard you went to live with Muggles , ” said Ron .\\n “ What are they like ? ”\\n “ Horrible well , not all of them .\\n My aunt and uncle and cousin are , though .\\n Wish I’d had three wizard brothers . ”\\n “ Five , ” said Ron .\\n For some reason , he was looking gloomy .\\n “ I’m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts .\\n You could say I’ve got a lot to live up to .\\n Bill and Charlie have already left Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch .\\n Now Percy’s a prefect .\\n Fred and George mess around a lot , but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they’re really funny .\\n Everyone expects me to do as well as the others , but if I do , it’s no big deal , because they did it first .\\n You never get anything new , either , with five brothers .\\n I’ve got Bill’s old robes , Charlie’s old wand , and Percy’s old rat . ”\\n Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat , which was asleep .\\n “ His name’s Scabbers and he’s useless , he hardly ever wakes up .\\n Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect , but they couldn’t aff I mean , I got Scabbers instead . ”\\n Ron’s ears went pink .\\n He seemed to think he’d said too much , because he went back to staring out of the window .\\n Harry didn’t think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl .\\n After all , he’d never had any money in his life until a month ago , and he told Ron so , all about having to wear Dudley’s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents .\\n This seemed to cheer Ron up . “\\n and until Hagrid told me , I didn’t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort ” Ron gasped .\\n “ What ? ”\\n said Harry .\\n “ You said You Know Who’s name ” said Ron , sounding both shocked and impressed .\\n “ I’d have thought you , of all people ” “ I’m not trying to be brave or anything , saying the name , ” said Harry , “ I just never knew you shouldn’t .\\n See what I mean ?\\n I’ve got loads to learn .\\n I bet , ” he added , voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately , “ I bet I’m the worst in the class . ”\\n “ You won’t be .\\n There’s loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough . ”\\n While they had been talking , the train had carried them out of London .\\n Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep .\\n They were quiet for a time , watching the fields and lanes flick past .\\n Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling , dimpled woman slid back their door and said , “ Anything off the cart , dears ? ”\\n Harry , who hadn’t had any breakfast , leapt to his feet , but Ron’s ears went pink again and he muttered that he’d brought sandwiches .\\n Harry went out into the corridor .\\n He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys , and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry but the woman didn’t have Mars Bars .\\n What she did have were Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans , Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum , Chocolate Frogs , Pumpkin Pasties , Cauldron Cakes , Licorice Wands , and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life .\\n Not wanting to miss anything , he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts .\\n Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat .\\n “ Hungry , are you ? ”\\n “ Starving , ” said Harry , taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty .\\n Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it .\\n There were four sandwiches inside .\\n He pulled one of them apart and said , “ She always forgets I don’t like corned beef . ”\\n “ Swap you for one of these , ” said Harry , holding up a pasty .\\n “ Go on ” “ You don’t want this , it’s all dry , ” said Ron .\\n “ She hasn’t got much time , ” he added quickly , “ you know , with five of us . ”\\n “ Go on , have a pasty , ” said Harry , who had never had anything to share before or , indeed , anyone to share it with .\\n It was a nice feeling , sitting there with Ron , eating their way through all Harry’s pasties , cakes , and candies ( the sandwiches lay forgotten ) .\\n “ What are these ? ”\\n Harry asked Ron , holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs .\\n “ They’re not really frogs , are they ? ”\\n He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him .\\n “ No , ” said Ron .\\n “ But see what the card is .\\n I’m missing Agrippa . ”\\n “ What ? ”\\n “ Oh , of course , you wouldn’t know Chocolate Frogs have cards inside them , you know , to collect famous witches and wizards .\\n I’ve got about five hundred , but I haven’t got Agrippa or Ptolemy . ”\\n Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card .\\n It showed a man’s face .\\n He wore half moon glasses , had a long , crooked nose , and flowing silver hair , beard , and mustache .\\n Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore .\\n “ So this is Dumbledore ! ”\\n said Harry .\\n “ Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Dumbledore ! ”\\n said Ron .\\n “ Can I have a frog ?\\n I might get Agrippa thanks Harry turned over his card and read : ALBUS DUMBLEDORE CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times , Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945 , for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood , and his work on alchemy with his partner , Nicolas Flamel .\\n Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and ten pin bowling .\\n Harry turned the card back over and saw , to his astonishment , that Dumbledore ’ s face had disappeared .\\n “ He’s gone ! ”\\n “ Well , you can’t expect him to hang around all day , ” said Ron .\\n “ He’ll be back .\\n No , I’ve got Morgana again and I’ve got about six of her do you want it ?\\n You can start collecting . ”\\n Ron’s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped .\\n “ Help yourself , ” said Harry .\\n “ But in , you know , the Muggle world , people just stay put in photos . ”\\n “ Do they ?\\n What , they don’t move at all ? ”\\n Ron sounded amazed .\\n “ Weird ) . ”\\n Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile .\\n Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards , but Harry couldn’t keep his eyes off them .\\n Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana , but Hengist of Woodcraft , Alberic Grunnion , Circe , Paracelsus , and Merlin .\\n He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna , who was scratching her nose , to open a bag of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans .\\n “ You want to be careful with those , ” Ron warned Harry .\\n “ When they say every flavor , they mean every flavor you know , you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade , but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe .\\n George reckons he had a booger flavored one once . ”\\n Ron picked up a green bean , looked at it carefully , and bit into a corner .\\n “ Bleaaargh see ?\\n Sprouts . ”\\n They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans .\\n Harry got toast , coconut , baked bean , strawberry , curry , grass , coffee , sardine , and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn’t touch , which turned out to be pepper .\\n The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder .\\n The neat fields had gone .\\n Now there were woods , twisting rivers , and dark green hills .\\n There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and three quarters came in .\\n He looked tearful .\\n “ Sorry , ” he said , “ but have you seen a toad at all ? ”\\n When they shook their heads , he wailed , “ I’ve lost him !\\n He keeps getting away from me ! ”\\n “ Hell turn up , ” said Harry .\\n “ Yes , ” said the boy miserably .\\n “ Well , if you see him ” He left .\\n “ Don’t know why he’s so bothered , ” said Ron .\\n “ If I’d brought a toad I’d lose it as quick as I could .\\n Mind you , I brought Scabbers , so I can’t talk . ”\\n The rat was still snoozing on Ron’s lap .\\n “ He might have died and you wouldn’t know the difference , ” said Ron in disgust .\\n “ I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting , but the spell didn’t work .\\n I’ll show you , look ” He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered looking wand .\\n It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end .\\n “ Unicorn hair’s nearly poking out .\\n Anyway ” He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again .\\n The toadless boy was back , but this time he had a girl with him .\\n She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes .\\n “ Has anyone seen a toad ?\\n Neville’s lost one , ” she said .\\n She had a bossy sort of voice , lots of bushy brown hair , and rather large front teeth .\\n “ We’ve already told him we haven’t seen it , ” said Ron , but the girl wasn’t listening , she was looking at the wand in his hand .\\n “ Oh , are you doing magic ?\\n Let’s see it , then . ”\\n She sat down .\\n Ron looked taken aback .\\n “ Er all right . ”\\n He cleared his throat .\\n “ Sunshine , daisies , butter mellow , Turn this stupid , fat rat yellow . ”\\n He waved his wand , but nothing happened .\\n Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep .\\n “ Are you sure that’s a real spell ? ”\\n said the girl .\\n “ Well , it’s not very good , is it ?\\n I’ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it’s all worked for me .\\n Nobody in my family’s magic at all , it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter , but I was ever so pleased , of course , I mean , it’s the very best school of witchcraft there is , I’ve heard I’ve learned all our course books by heart , of course , I just hope it will be enough I’m Hermione Granger , by the way , who are you ? ”\\n She said all this very fast .\\n Harry looked at Ron , and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn’t learned all the course books by heart either .\\n “ I’m Ron Weasley , ” Ron muttered .\\n “ Harry Potter , ” said Harry .\\n “ Are you really ? ”\\n said Hermione .\\n “ I know all about you , of course I got a few extra books for background reading , and you’re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century . ”\\n “ Am I ? ”\\n said Harry , feeling dazed .\\n “ Goodness , didn’t you know , I’d have found out everything I could if it was me , ” said Hermione .\\n “ Do either of you know what House you’ll be in ?\\n I’ve been asking around , and I hope I’m in Gryffindor , it sounds by far the best I hear Dumbledore himself was in it , but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad .\\n Anyway , we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad .\\n You two had better change , you know , I expect we’ll be there soon . ”\\n And she left , taking the toadless boy with her .\\n “ Whatever House I’m in , I hope she’s not in it , ” said Ron .\\n He threw his wand back into his trunk .\\n “ Stupid spell George gave it to me , bet he knew it was a dud . ”\\n “ What House are your brothers in ? ”\\n asked Harry .\\n “ Gryffindor , ” said Ron .\\n Gloom seemed to be settling on him again .\\n “ Mom and Dad were in it , too .\\n I don’t know what they’ll say if I’m not .\\n I don’t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad , but imagine if they put me in Slytherin . ”\\n “ That’s the House Vol , I mean , You Know Who was in ? ”\\n “ Yeah , ” said Ron .\\n He flopped back into his seat , looking depressed .\\n “ You know , I think the ends of Scabbers ’ whiskers are a bit lighter , ” said Harry , trying to take Ron’s mind off Houses .\\n “ So what do your oldest brothers do now that they’ve left , anyway ? ”\\n Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he’d finished school .\\n “ Charlie’s in Romania studying dragons , and Bill’s in Africa doing something for Gringotts , ” said Ron .\\n “ Did you hear about Gringotts ?\\n It’s been all over the Daily Prophet , but I don’t suppose you get that with the Muggles someone tried to rob a high security vault . ”\\n Harry stared .\\n “ Really ?\\n What happened to them ? ”\\n “ Nothing , that’s why it’s such big news .\\n They haven’t been caught .\\n My dad says it must’ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts , but they don’t think they took anything , that’s what’s odd .\\n ’ Course , everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You Know Who’s behind it . ”\\n Harry turned this news over in his mind .\\n He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You Know Who was mentioned .\\n He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world , but it had been a lot more comfortable saying “ Voldemort ” without worrying .\\n “ What’s your Quidditch team ? ”\\n Ron asked .\\n “ Er I don’t know any , ” Harry confessed .\\n “ What ! ”\\n Ron looked dumbfounded .\\n “ Oh , you wait , it’s the best game in the world ” And he was off , explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players , describing famous games he’d been to with his brothers and the broomstick he’d like to get if he had the money .\\n He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again , but it wasn’t Neville the toadless boy , or Hermione Granger this time .\\n Three boys entered , and Harry recognized the middle one at once : It was the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop .\\n He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he’d shown back in Diagon Alley .\\n “ Is it true ? ”\\n he said .\\n “ They’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s in this compartment .\\n So it’s you , is it ? ”\\n “ Yes , ” said Harry .\\n He was looking at the other boys .\\n Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean .\\n Standing on either side of the pale boy , they looked like bodyguards .\\n “ Oh , this is Crabbe and this is Goyle , ” said the pale boy carelessly , noticing where Harry was looking .\\n “ And my names Malfoy , Draco Malfoy . ”\\n Ron gave a slight cough , which might have been hiding a snigger .\\n Draco Malfoy looked at him .\\n “ Think my name’s funny , do you ?\\n No need to ask who you are .\\n My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair , freckles , and more children than they can afford . ”\\n He turned back to Harry .\\n “ You’ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others , Potter .\\n You don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort .\\n I can help you there . ”\\n He held out his hand to shake Harry’s , but Harry didn’t take it .\\n “ I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself , thanks , ” he said coolly .\\n Draco Malfoy didn’t go red , but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks .\\n “ I’d be careful if I were you , Potter , ” he said slowly .\\n “ Unless you’re a bit politer you’ll go the same way as your parents .\\n They didn’t know what was good for them , either .\\n You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid , and it’ll rub off on you . ”\\n Both Harry and Ron stood up .\\n “ Say that again , ” Ron said , his face as red as his hair .\\n “ Oh , you’re going to fight us , are you ? ”\\n Malfoy sneered .\\n “ Unless you get out now , ” said Harry , more bravely than he felt , because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron .\\n “ But we don’t feel like leaving , do we , boys ?\\n We’ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some . ”\\n Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron Ron leapt forward , but before he’d so much as touched Goyle , Goyle let out a horrible yell .\\n Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger , sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle ’ s knuckle Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round , howling , and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window , all three of them disappeared at once .\\n Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets , or perhaps they’d heard footsteps , because a second later , Hermione Granger had come in .\\n “ What has been going on ? ”\\n she said , looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail .\\n “ I think he’s been knocked out , ” Ron said to Harry .\\n He looked closer at Scabbers .\\n “ No I don’t believe it he’s gone back to sleep . ”\\n And so he had .\\n “ You’ve met Malfoy before ? ”\\n Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley .\\n “ I’ve heard of his family , ” said Ron darkly .\\n “ They were some of the first to come back to our side after You Know Who disappeared .\\n Said they’d been bewitched .\\n My dad doesn’t believe it .\\n He says Malfoy’s father didn’t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side . ”\\n He turned to Hermione .\\n “ Can we help you with something ? ”\\n “ You’d better hurry up and put your robes on , I’ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor , and he says we’re nearly there .\\n You haven’t been fighting , have you ?\\n You’ll be in trouble before we even get there ! ”\\n “ Scabbers has been fighting , not us , ” said Ron , scowling at her .\\n “ Would you mind leaving while we change ? ”\\n “ All right I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly , racing up and down the corridors , ” said Hermione in a sniffy voice .\\n “ And you’ve got dirt on your nose , by the way , did you know ? ”\\n Ron glared at her as she left .\\n Harry peered out of the window .\\n It was getting dark .\\n He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky .\\n The train did seem to be slowing down .\\n He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes .\\n Ron’s were a bit short for him , you could see his sneakers underneath them .\\n A voice echoed through the train : “ We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes ’ time .\\n Please leave your luggage on the train , it will be taken to the school separately . ”\\n Harry’s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron , he saw , looked pale under his freckles .\\n They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor .\\n The train slowed right down and finally stopped .\\n People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny , dark platform .\\n Harry shivered in the cold night air .\\n Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students , and Harry heard a familiar voice : “ Firs ’ years !\\n Firs ’ years over here !\\n All right there , Harry ? ”\\n Hagrid’s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads .\\n “ C’mon , follow me any more firs ’ years ?\\n Mind yer step , now !\\n Firs ’ years follow me ! ”\\n Slipping and stumbling , they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep , narrow path .\\n It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there .\\n Nobody spoke much .\\n Neville , the boy who kept losing his toad , sniffed once or twice .\\n “ Yeh’ll get yer firs ’ sight o ’ Hogwarts in a sec , ” Hagrid called over his shoulder , “ jus ’ round this bend here . ”\\n There was a loud “ Oooooh ! ”\\n The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake .\\n Perched atop a high mountain on the other side , its windows sparkling in the starry sky , was a vast castle with many turrets and towers .\\n “ No more’n four to a boat ! ”\\n Hagrid called , pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore .\\n Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione .\\n “ Everyone in ? ”\\n shouted Hagrid , who had a boat to himself .\\n “ Right then FORWARD ! ”\\n And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once , gliding across the lake , which was as smooth as glass .\\n Everyone was silent , staring up at the great castle overhead .\\n It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood .\\n “ Heads down ! ”\\n yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face .\\n They were carried along a dark tunnel , which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle , until they reached a kind of underground harbor , where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles .\\n “ Oy , you there !\\n Is this your toad ? ”\\n said Hagrid , who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them .\\n “ Trevor ! ”\\n cried Neville blissfully , holding out his hands .\\n Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid’s lamp , coming out at last onto smooth , damp grass right in the shadow of the castle .\\n They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge , oak front door .\\n “ Everyone here ?\\n You there , still got yer toad ? ”\\n Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door .']]}"
