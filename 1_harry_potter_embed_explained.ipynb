”\\n Harry woke with a start .\\n His aunt rapped on the door again .\\n “ Up ! ”\\n she screeched .\\n Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove .\\n He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having .\\n It had been a good one .\\n There had been a flying motorcycle in it .\\n He had a funny feeling he’d had the same dream before .\\n His aunt was back outside the door .\\n “ Are you up yet ? ”\\n she demanded .\\n “ Nearly , ” said Harry .\\n “ Well , get a move on , I want you to look after the bacon .\\n And don’t you dare let it burn , I want everything perfect on Duddy’s birthday . ”\\n Harry groaned .\\n “ What did you say ? ”\\n his aunt snapped through the door .\\n “ Nothing , nothing ” Dudley’s birthday how could he have forgotten ?\\n Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks .\\n He found a pair under his bed and , after pulling a spider off one of them , put them on .\\n Harry was used to spiders , because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them , and that was where he slept .\\n When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen .\\n The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley’s birthday presents .\\n It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted , not to mention the second television and the racing bike .\\n Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry , as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise unless of course it involved punching somebody .\\n Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry , but he couldn’t often catch him .\\n Harry didn’t look it , but he was very fast .\\n Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard , but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age .\\n He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley’s , and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was .\\n Harry had a thin face , knobbly knees , black hair , and bright green eyes .\\n He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose .\\n The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning .\\n He had had it as long as he could remember , and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it .\\n “ In the car crash when your parents died , ” she had said .\\n “ And don’t ask questions . ”\\n Don’t ask questions that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys .\\n Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon .\\n “ Comb your hair ! ”\\n he barked , by way of a morning greeting .\\n About once a week , Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut .\\n Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together , but it made no difference , his hair simply grew that way all over the place .\\n Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother .\\n Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon .\\n He had a large pink face , not much neck , small , watery blue eyes , and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick , fat head .\\n Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig .\\n Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table , which was difficult as there wasn’t much room .\\n Dudley , meanwhile , was counting his presents .\\n His face fell .\\n “ Thirty six , ” he said , looking up at his mother and father .\\n “ That’s two less than last year . ”\\n “ Darling , you haven’t counted Auntie Marge’s present , see , it’s here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy . ”\\n “ All right , thirty seven then , ” said Dudley , going red in the face .\\n Harry , who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on , began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over .\\n Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger , too , because she said quickly , “ And we’ll buy you another two presents while we’re out today .\\n How’s that , popkin ?\\n Two more presents .\\n Is that all right ? ”\\n Dudley thought for a moment .\\n It looked like hard work .\\n Finally he said slowly , “ So I’ll have thirty thirty ” “ Thirty nine , sweetums , ” said Aunt Petunia .\\n “ Oh . ”\\n Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel .\\n “ All right then . ”\\n Uncle Vernon chuckled .\\n “ Little tyke wants his money’s worth , just like his father .\\n ’ Atta boy , Dudley ! ”\\n He ruffled Dudley’s hair .\\n At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike , a video camera , a remote control airplane , sixteen new computer games , and a VCR .\\n He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried .\\n “ Bad news , Vernon , ” she said .\\n “ Mrs Figg’s broken her leg .\\n She can’t take him . ”\\n She jerked her head in Harry’s direction .\\n Dudley’s mouth fell open in horror , but Harry’s heart gave a leap .\\n Every year on Dudley’s birthday , his parents took him and a friend out for the day , to adventure parks , hamburger restaurants , or the movies .\\n Every year , Harry was left behind with Mrs Figg , a mad old lady who lived two streets away .\\n Harry hated it there .\\n The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she’d ever owned .\\n “ Now what ? ”\\n said Aunt Petunia , looking furiously at Harry as though he’d planned this .\\n Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs Figg had broken her leg , but it wasn’t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbies , Snowy , Mr Paws , and Tufty again .\\n “ We could phone Marge , ” Uncle Vernon suggested .\\n “ Don’t be silly , Vernon , she hates the boy . ”\\n The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this , as though he wasn’t there or rather , as though he was something very nasty that couldn’t understand them , like a slug .\\n “ What about what’s her name , your friend Yvonne ? ”\\n “ On vacation in Majorca , ” snapped Aunt Petunia .\\n “ You could just leave me here , ” Harry put in hopefully ( he’d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley’s computer ) .\\n Aunt Petunia looked as though she’d just swallowed a lemon .\\n “ And come back and find the house in ruins ? ”\\n she snarled .\\n “ I won’t blow up the house , ” said Harry , but they weren’t listening .\\n “ I suppose we could take him to the zoo , ” said Aunt Petunia slowly , “ and leave him in the car . ”\\n “ That cars new , he’s not sitting in it alone . ”\\n Dudley began to cry loudly .\\n In fact , he wasn’t really crying it had been years since he’d really cried but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed , his mother would give him anything he wanted .\\n “ Dinky Duddydums , don’t cry , Mummy won’t let him spoil your special day ! ”\\n she cried , flinging her arms around him .\\n “ I don’t want him t t to come ! ”\\n Dudley yelled between huge , pretend sobs .\\n “ He always sp spoils everything ! ”\\n He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms .\\n Just then , the doorbell rang “ Oh , good Lord , they’re here ! ”\\n said Aunt Petunia frantically and a moment later , Dudley’s best friend , Piers Polkiss , walked in with his mother .\\n Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat .\\n He was usually the one who held people’s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them .\\n Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once .\\n Half an hour later , Harry , who couldn’t believe his luck , was sitting in the back of the Dursleys ’ car with Piers and Dudley , on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life .\\n His aunt and uncle hadn’t been able to think of anything else to do with him , but before they’d left , Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside .\\n “ I’m warning you , ” he had said , putting his large purple face right up close to Harry’s , “ I’m warning you now , boy any funny business , anything at all and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas . ”\\n I’m not going to do anything , ” said Harry , “ honestly But Uncle Vernon didn’t believe him .\\n No one ever did .\\n The problem was , strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn’t make them happen .\\n Once , Aunt Petunia , tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn’t been at all , had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs , which she left “ to hide that horrible scar . ”\\n Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry , who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day , where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses .\\n Next morning , however , he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off .\\n He had been given a week in his cupboard for this , even though he had tried to explain that he couldn’t explain how it had grown back so quickly .\\n Another time , Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley’s ( brown with orange puff balls ) .\\n The harder she tried to pull it over his head , the smaller it seemed to become , until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet , but certainly wouldn’t fit Harry .\\n Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and , to his great relief , Harry wasn’t punished .\\n On the other hand , he’d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens .\\n Dudley’s gang had been chasing him as usual when , as much to Harry’s surprise as anyone else’s , there he was sitting on the chimney .\\n The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry’s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings .\\n But all he’d tried to do ( as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard ) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors .\\n Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid jump .\\n But today , nothing was going to go wrong .\\n It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn’t school , his cupboard , or Mrs Figg’s cabbage smelling living room .\\n While he drove , Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia .\\n He liked to complain about things : people at work , Harry , the council , Harry , the bank , and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects .\\n This morning , it was motorcycles . “\\n roaring along like maniacs , the young hoodlums , ” he said , as a motorcycle overtook them .\\n “ I had a dream about a motorcycle , ” said Harry , remembering suddenly .\\n “ It was flying . ”\\n Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front .\\n He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry , his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache : “ MOTORCYCLES DONT FLY ! ”\\n Dudley and Piers sniggered .\\n “ I know they don’t , ” said Harry .\\n “ It was only a dream . ”\\n But he wished he hadn’t said anything .\\n If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions , it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn’t , no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas .\\n It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families .\\n The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then , because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away , they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop .\\n It wasn’t bad , either , Harry thought , licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley , except that it wasn’t blond .\\n Harry had the best morning he’d had in a long time .\\n He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers , who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime , wouldn’t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him .\\n They ate in the zoo restaurant , and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice cream on top , Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first .\\n Harry felt , afterward , that he should have known it was all too good to last .\\n After lunch they went to the reptile house .\\n It was cool and dark in there , with lit windows all along the walls .\\n Behind the glass , all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone .\\n Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge , poisonous cobras and thick , man crushing pythons .\\n Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place .\\n It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon’s car and crushed it into a trash can but at the moment it didn’t look in the mood .\\n In fact , it was fast asleep .\\n Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass , staring at the glistening brown coils .\\n “ Make it move , ” he whined at his father .\\n Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass , but the snake didn’t budge .\\n “ Do it again , ” Dudley ordered .\\n Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles , but the snake just snoozed on .\\n “ This is boring , ” Dudley moaned .\\n He shuffled away .\\n Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake .\\n He wouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long .\\n It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom , where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up at least he got to visit the rest of the house .\\n The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes .\\n Slowly , very slowly , it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry’s .\\n It winked .\\n Harry stared .\\n Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching .\\n They weren’t .\\n He looked back at the snake and winked , too .\\n The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley , then raised its eyes to the ceiling .\\n It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly : “ I get that all the time . ”\\n “ I know , ” Harry murmured through the glass , though he wasn’t sure the snake could hear him .\\n “ It must be really annoying . ”\\n The snake nodded vigorously .\\n “ Where do you come from , anyway ? ”\\n Harry asked .\\n The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass .\\n Harry peered at it .\\n Boa Constrictor , Brazil .\\n “ Was it nice there ? ”\\n The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on : This specimen was bred in the zoo .\\n “ Oh , I see so you’ve never been to Brazil ? ”\\n As the snake shook its head , a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump .\\n “ DUDLEY !\\n MR DURSLEY !\\n COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE !\\n YOU WONT BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING ! ”\\n Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could .\\n “ Out of the way , you , ” he said , punching Harry in the ribs .\\n Caught by surprise , Harry fell hard on the concrete floor .\\n What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened one second , Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass , the next , they had leapt back with howls of horror .\\n Harry sat up and gasped the glass front of the boa constrictor’s tank had vanished .\\n The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly , slithering out onto the floor .\\n People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits .\\n As the snake slid swiftly past him , Harry could have sworn a low , hissing voice said , “ Brazil , here I come .\\n Thanksss , amigo . ”\\n The keeper of the reptile house was in shock .\\n “ But the glass , ” he kept saying , “ where did the glass go ? ” “\\n The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong , sweet tea while he apologized over and over again .\\n Piers and Dudley could only gibber .\\n As far as Harry had seen , the snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed , but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car , Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg , while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death .\\n But worst of all , for Harry at least , was Piers calming down enough to say , “ Harry was talking to it , weren’t you , Harry ? ”\\n Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry .\\n He was so angry he could hardly speak .\\n He managed to say , “ Go cupboard stay no meals , ” before he collapsed into a chair , and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy .\\n Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later , wishing he had a watch .\\n He didn’t know what time it was and he couldn’t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet .\\n Until they were , he couldn’t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food .\\n He’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years , ten miserable years , as long as he could remember , ever since he’d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash .\\n He couldn’t remember being in the car when his parents had died .\\n Sometimes , when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard , he came up with a strange vision : a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead .\\n This , he supposed , was the crash , though he couldn’t imagine where all the green light came from .\\n He couldn’t remember his parents at all .\\n His aunt and uncle never spoke about them , and of course he was forbidden to ask questions .\\n There were no photographs of them in the house .\\n When he had been younger , Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away , but it had never happened the Dursleys were his only family .\\n Yet sometimes he thought ( or maybe hoped ) that strangers in the street seemed to know him .\\n Very strange strangers they were , too .\\n A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley .\\n After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man , Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything .\\n A wild looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus .\\n A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word .\\n The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look .\\n At school , Harry had no one .\\n Everybody knew that Dudley’s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses , and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s gang .',\n",
       "   'Chapter : THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest ever punishment .\\n By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again , the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera , crashed his remote control airplane , and , first time out on his racing bike , knocked down old Mrs Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches .\\n Harry was glad school was over , but there was no escaping Dudley’s gang , who visited the house every single day .\\n Piers , Dennis , Malcolm , and Gordon were all big and stupid , but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot , he was the leader .\\n The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley’s favorite sport : Harry Hunting .\\n This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house , wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays , where he could see a tiny ray of hope .\\n When September came he would be going off to secondary school and , for the first time in his life , he wouldn’t be with Dudley .\\n Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon’s old private school , Smeltings .\\n Piers Polkiss was going there too .\\n Harry , on the other hand , was going to Stonewall High , the local public school .\\n Dudley thought this was very funny .\\n “ They stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall , ” he told Harry .\\n “ Want to come upstairs and practice ? ”\\n “ No , thanks , ” said Harry .\\n “ The poor toilet’s never had anything as horrible as your head down it it might be sick . ”\\n Then he ran , before Dudley could work out what he’d said .\\n One day in July , Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform , leaving Harry at Mrs Figg’s .\\n Mrs Figg wasn’t as bad as usual .\\n It turned out she’d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats , and she didn’t seem quite as fond of them as before .\\n She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she’d had it for several years .\\n That evening , Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand new uniform .\\n Smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats , orange knickerbockers , and flat straw hats called boaters .\\n They also carried knobbly sticks , used for hitting each other while the teachers weren’t looking .\\n This was supposed to be good training for later life .\\n As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers , Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life .\\n Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn’t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins , he looked so handsome and grown up .\\n Harry didn’t trust himself to speak .\\n He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh .\\n k k k There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast .\\n It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink .\\n He went to have a look .\\n The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water .\\n “ What’s this ? ”\\n he asked Aunt Petunia .\\n Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question .\\n “ Your new school uniform , ” she said .\\n Harry looked in the bowl again .\\n “ Oh , ” he said , “ I didn’t realize it had to be so wet . ”\\n “ Don’t be stupid , ” snapped Aunt Petunia .\\n “ I’m dyeing some of Dudley’s old things gray for you .\\n It’ll look just like everyone else’s when I’ve finished . ”\\n Harry seriously doubted this , but thought it best not to argue .\\n He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin , probably .\\n Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in , both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry’s new uniform .\\n Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick , which he carried everywhere , on the table .\\n They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat .\\n “ Get the mail , Dudley , ” said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper .\\n “ Make Harry get it . ”\\n “ Get the mail , Harry . ”\\n “ Make Dudley get it . ”\\n “ Poke him with your Smelting stick , Dudley . ”\\n Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail .\\n Three things lay on the doormat : a postcard from Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge , who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight , a brown envelope that looked like a bill , and a letter for Harry .\\n Harry picked it up and stared at it , his heart twanging like a giant elastic band .\\n No one , ever , in his whole life , had written to him .\\n Who would ?\\n He had no friends , no other relatives he didn’t belong to the library , so he’d never even got rude notes asking for books back .\\n Yet here it was , a letter , addressed so plainly there could be no mistake : Mr H .\\n Potter The Cupboard under the Stairs 4 Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey The envelope was thick and heavy , made of yellowish parchment , and the address was written in emerald green ink .\\n There was no stamp .\\n Turning the envelope over , his hand trembling , Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms a lion , an eagle , a badger , and a snake surrounding a large letter H .\\n “ Hurry up , boy ! ”\\n shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen .\\n “ What are you doing , checking for letter bombs ? ”\\n He chuckled at his own joke .\\n Harry went back to the kitchen , still staring at his letter .\\n He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard , sat down , and slowly began to open the yellow envelope .\\n Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill , snorted in disgust , and flipped over the postcard .\\n “ Marge’s ill , ” he informed Aunt Petunia .\\n “ Ate a funny whelk ” “ Dad ! ”\\n said Dudley suddenly .\\n “ Dad , Harry’s got something ! ”\\n Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter , which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope , when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon .\\n “ That’s mine ” said Harry , trying to snatch it back .\\n “ Who’d be writing to you ? ”\\n sneered Uncle Vernon , shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it .\\n His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights .\\n And it didn’t stop there .\\n Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge .\\n “ P P Petunia ! ”\\n he gasped .\\n Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it , but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach .\\n Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line .\\n For a moment it looked as though she might faint .\\n She clutched her throat and made a choking noise .\\n “ Vernon !\\n Oh my goodness Vernon ! ”\\n They stared at each other , seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room .\\n Dudley wasn’t used to being ignored .\\n He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick .\\n “ I want to read that letter , ” he said loudly .\\n “ I want to read it , ” said Harry furiously , “ as it’s mine . ”\\n “ Get out , both of you , ” croaked Uncle Vernon , stuffing the letter back inside its envelope .\\n Harry didn’t move .\\n “ I WANT MY LETTER ! ”\\n he shouted .\\n “ Let me see it ! ”\\n demanded Dudley .\\n “ OUT ! ”\\n roared Uncle Vernon , and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall , slamming the kitchen door behind them .\\n Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole Dudley won , so Harry , his glasses dangling from one ear , lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor .\\n “ Vernon , ” Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice , “ look at the address how could they possibly know where he sleeps ?\\n You don’t think they’re watching the house ? ”\\n “ Watching spying might be following us , ” muttered Uncle Vernon wildly .\\n “ But what should we do , Vernon ?\\n Should we write back ?\\n Tell them we don’t want ” Harry could see Uncle Vernon’s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen .\\n “ No , ” he said finally .\\n “ No , we’ll ignore it .\\n If they don’t get an answer .\\n Yes , that’s best we won’t do anything . ”\\n “ But ” “ I’m not having one in the house , Petunia !\\n Didn’t we swear when we took him in we’d stamp out that dangerous nonsense ? ”\\n That evening when he got back from work , Uncle Vernon did something he’d never done before he visited Harry in his cupboard .\\n “ Where’s my letter ? ”\\n said Harry , the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door .\\n “ Who’s writing to me ? ”\\n “ No one .\\n It was addressed to you by mistake , ” said Uncle Vernon shortly .\\n “ I have burned it . ”\\n “ It was not a mistake , ” said Harry angrily , “ it had my cupboard on it . ”\\n “ SILENCE ! ”\\n yelled Uncle Vernon , and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling .\\n He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile , which looked quite painful .\\n “ Er yes , Harry about this cupboard .\\n Your aunt and I have been thinking you’re really getting a bit big for it we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley’s second bedroom . ”\\n “ Why ? ”\\n said Harry .\\n “ Don’t ask questions ! ”\\n snapped his uncle .\\n “ Take this stuff upstairs , now . ”\\n The Dursleys ’ house had four bedrooms : one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia , one for visitors ( usually Uncle Vernon’s sister , Marge ) , one where Dudley slept , and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn’t fit into his first bedroom .\\n It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room .\\n He sat down on the bed and stared around him .\\n Nearly everything in here was broken .\\n The month old video camera was lying on top of a small , working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor’s dog in the corner was Dudley’s first ever television set , which he’d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled there was a large birdcage , which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle , which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it .\\n Other shelves were full of books .\\n They were the only things in the room that looked as though they’d never been touched .\\n From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother , “ I don’t want him in there I need that room make him get out . ”\\n Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed .\\n Yesterday he’d have given anything to be up here .\\n Today he’d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it .\\n Next morning at breakfast , everyone was rather quiet .\\n Dudley was in shock .\\n He’d screamed , whacked his father with his Smelting stick , been sick on purpose , kicked his mother , and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof , and he still didn’t have his room back .\\n Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he’d opened the letter in the hall .\\n Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly .\\n When the mail arrived , Uncle Vernon , who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry , made Dudley go and get it .\\n They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall .\\n Then he shouted , “ There’s another one !\\n ‘ Mr H .\\n Potter , The Smallest Bedroom , 4 Privet Drive ’ ” With a strangled cry , Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall , Harry right behind him .\\n Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him , which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind .\\n After a minute of confused fighting , in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick , Uncle Vernon straightened up , gasping for breath , with Harry’s letter clutched in his hand .\\n “ Go to your cupboard I mean , your bedroom , ” he wheezed at Harry .\\n “ Dudley go just go . ”\\n Harry walked round and round his new room .\\n Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn’t received his first letter .\\n Surely that meant they’d try again ?\\n And this time he’d make sure they didn’t fail .\\n He had a plan .\\n The repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next morning .\\n Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently .\\n He mustn’t wake the Dursleys .\\n He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights .\\n He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first .\\n His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door “ AAAAARRRGH ! ”\\n Harry leapt into the air he’d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat something alive Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big , squashy something had been his uncle’s face .\\n Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag , clearly making sure that Harry didn’t do exactly what he’d been trying to do .\\n He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea .\\n Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back , the mail had arrived , right into Uncle Vernon’s lap .\\n Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink .\\n “ I want ” he began , but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes .\\n Uncle Vernon didn’t go to work that day .\\n He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot .\\n “ See , ” he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails , “ if they can’t deliver them they’ll just give up . ”\\n “ I’m not sure that’ll work , Vernon . ”\\n “ Oh , these peoples minds work in strange ways , Petunia , they’re not like you and me , ” said Uncle Vernon , trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him .\\n On Friday , no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry .\\n As they couldn’t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door , slotted through the sides , and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom .\\n Uncle Vernon stayed at home again .\\n After burning all the letters , he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out .\\n He hummed “ Tiptoe Through the Tulips ” as he worked , and jumped at small noises .\\n On Saturday , things began to get out of hand .\\n Twenty four letters to Harry found their way into the house , rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window .\\n While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to , Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor .\\n “ Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly ? ”\\n Dudley asked Harry in amazement .\\n On Sunday morning , Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill , but happy .\\n “ No post on Sundays , ” he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers , “ no damn letters today ” Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head .\\n Next moment , thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets .\\n The Dursleys ducked , but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one “ Out !\\n OUT ! ”\\n Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall .\\n When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces , Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut .\\n They could hear the letters still streaming into the room , bouncing off the walls and floor .\\n “ That does it , ” said Uncle Vernon , trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time .\\n “ I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave .\\n We’re going away .\\n Just pack some clothes .\\n No arguments ! ”\\n He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue .\\n Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded up doors and were in the car , speeding toward the highway .\\n Dudley was sniffling in the back seat his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television , VCR , and computer in his sports bag .\\n They drove .\\n And they drove .\\n Even Aunt Petunia didn’t dare ask where they were going .\\n Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while .\\n “ Shake ’ em off shake ’ em off , ” he would mutter whenever he did this .\\n They didn’t stop to eat or drink all day .\\n By nightfall Dudley was howling .\\n He’d never had such a bad day in his life .\\n He was hungry , he’d missed five television programs he’d wanted to see , and he’d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer .\\n Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city .\\n Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp , musty sheets .\\n Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake , sitting on the windowsill , staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day .\\n They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table .\\n “ ’ Scuse me , but is one of you Mr H .\\n Potter ?\\n Only I got about an ’ undred of these at the front desk . ”\\n She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address : Mr H .\\n Potter Room 1 7 Railview Hotel Cokeworth Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way .\\n The woman stared .\\n “ I’ll take them , ” said Uncle Vernon , standing up quickly and following her from the dining room .\\n “ Wouldn’t it be better just to go home , dear ? ”\\n Aunt Petunia suggested timidly , hours later , but Uncle Vernon didn’t seem to hear her .\\n Exactly what he was looking for , none of them knew .\\n He drove them into the middle of a forest , got out , looked around , shook his head , got back in the car , and off they went again .\\n The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field , halfway across a suspension bridge , and at the top of a multilevel parking garage .\\n “ Daddy’s gone mad , hasn’t he ? ”\\n Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon .\\n Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast , locked them all inside the car , and disappeared .\\n It started to rain .\\n Great drops beat on the roof of the car .\\n Dudley sniveled .\\n “ It’s Monday , ” he told his mother .\\n “ The Great Humberto’s on tonight .\\n I want to stay somewhere with a television . ”\\n Monday .\\n This reminded Harry of something .\\n If it was Monday and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days of the week , because of television then tomorrow , Tuesday , was Harry’s eleventh birthday .\\n Of course , his birthdays were never exactly fun last year , the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks .\\n Still , you weren’t eleven every day .\\n Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling .\\n He was also carrying a long , thin package and didn’t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he’d bought .\\n “ Found the perfect place ! ”\\n he said .\\n “ Come on !\\n Everyone out ! ”\\n It was very cold outside the car .\\n Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea .\\n Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine .\\n One thing was certain , there was no television in there .\\n “ Storm forecast for tonight ! ”\\n said Uncle Vernon gleefully , clapping his hands together .\\n “ And this gentleman’s kindly agreed to lend us his boat ! ”\\n A toothless old man came ambling up to them , pointing , with a rather wicked grin , at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron gray water below them .\\n “ I’ve already got us some rations , ” said Uncle Vernon , “ so all aboard ! ”\\n It was freezing in the boat .\\n Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces .\\n After what seemed like hours they reached the rock , where Uncle Vernon , slipping and sliding , led the way to the broken down house .\\n The inside was horrible it smelled strongly of seaweed , the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls , and the fireplace was damp and empty .\\n There were only two rooms .\\n Uncle Vernon’s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas .\\n He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up .\\n “ Could do with some of those letters now , eh ? ”\\n he said cheerfully .\\n He was in a very good mood .\\n Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail .\\n Harry privately agreed , though the thought didn’t cheer him up at all .\\n As night fell , the promised storm blew up around them .\\n Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows .\\n Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth eaten sofa .\\n She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door , and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest , most ragged blanket .\\n The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on .\\n Harry couldn’t sleep .\\n He shivered and turned over , trying to get comfortable , his stomach rumbling with hunger .\\n Dudley’s snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight .\\n The lighted dial of Dudley’s watch , which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist , told Harry he’d be eleven in ten minutes ’ time .\\n He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer , wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all , wondering where the letter writer was now .\\n Five minutes to go .\\n Harry heard something creak outside .\\n He hoped the roof wasn’t going to fall in , although he might be warmer if it did .\\n Four minutes to go .\\n Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he’d be able to steal one somehow .\\n Three minutes to go .\\n Was that the sea , slapping hard on the rock like that ?\\n And ( two minutes to go ) what was that funny crunching noise ?\\n Was the rock crumbling into the sea ?\\n One minute to go and he’d be eleven .\\n Thirty seconds twenty ten nine maybe he’d wake Dudley up , just to annoy him three two one BOOM .\\n The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright , staring at the door .\\n Someone was outside , knocking to come in .',\n",
       "   'Chapter : THE MIRROR OF ERISED .\\n Christmas was coming .\\n One morning in mid December , Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow .\\n The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around , bouncing off the back of his turban .\\n The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again .\\n No one could wait for the holidays to start .\\n While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires , the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms .\\n Worst of all were Professor Snape’s classes down in the dungeons , where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons .\\n “ I do feel so sorry , ” said Draco Malfoy , one Potions class , “ for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they’re not wanted at home . ”\\n He was looking over at Harry as he spoke .\\n Crabbe and Goyle chuckled .\\n Harry , who was measuring out powdered spine of lion fish , ignored them .\\n Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match .\\n Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost , he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next .\\n Then he’d realized that nobody found this funny , because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick .\\n So Malfoy , jealous and angry , had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family .\\n It was true that Harry wasn’t going back to Privet Drive for Christmas .\\n Professor McGonagall had come around the week before , making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays , and Harry had signed up at once .\\n He didn’t feel sorry for himself at all this would probably be the best Christmas he’d ever had .\\n Ron and his brothers were staying , too , because Mr and Mrs Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie .\\n When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions , they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead .\\n Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it .\\n “ Hi , Hagrid , want any help ? ”\\n Ron asked , sticking his head through the branches .\\n “ Nah , I’m all right , thanks , Ron . ”\\n “ Would you mind moving out of the way ? ”\\n came Malfoy’s cold drawl from behind them .\\n “ Are you trying to earn some extra money , Weasley ?\\n Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts , I suppose that hut of Hagrid’s must seem like a palace compared to what your family’s used to . ”\\n Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs .\\n “ WEASLEY ! ”\\n Ron let go of the front of Malfoy’s robes .\\n “ He was provoked , Professor Snape , ” said Hagrid , sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree .\\n “ Malfoy was insultin ’ his family . ”\\n “ Be that as it may , fighting is against Hogwarts rules , Hagrid , ” said Snape silkily .\\n “ Five points from Gryffindor , Weasley , and be grateful it isn’t more .\\n Move along , all of you . ”\\n Malfoy , Crabbe , and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree , scattering needles everywhere and smirking .\\n “ I’ll get him , ” said Ron , grinding his teeth at Malfoy’s back , “ one of these days , I’ll get him ” “ I hate them both , ” said Harry , “ Malfoy and Snape . ”\\n “ Come on , cheer up , it’s nearly Christmas , ” said Hagrid .\\n “ Tell yeh what , come with me an ’ see the Great Hall , looks a treat . ”\\n So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the Great Hall , where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations .\\n “ Ah , Hagrid , the last tree put it in the far corner , would you ? ”\\n The hall looked spectacular .\\n Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls , and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room , some sparkling with tiny icicles , some glittering with hundreds of candles .\\n “ How many days you got left until yer holidays ? ”\\n Hagrid asked .\\n “ Just one , ” said Hermione .\\n “ And that reminds me Harry , Ron , we’ve got half an hour before lunch , we should be in the library . ”\\n “ Oh yeah , you’re right , ” said Ron , tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick , who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree .\\n “ The library ? ”\\n said Hagrid , following them out of the hall .\\n “ Just before the holidays ?\\n Bit keen , aren’t yeh ? ”\\n “ Oh , we’re not working , ” Harry told him brightly .\\n “ Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we’ve been trying to find out who he is . ”\\n “ You what ? ”\\n Hagrid looked shocked .\\n “ Listen here I’ve told yeh drop it .\\n It’s nothin ’ to you what that dog’s guardin ’ . ”\\n “ We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is , that’s all , ” said Hermione .\\n “ Unless you’d like to tell us and save us the trouble ? ”\\n Harry added .\\n “ We must’ve been through hundreds of books already and we can’t find him anywhere just give us a hint I know I’ve read his name somewhere . ”\\n “ I’m sayin ’ nothin ’ , ” said Hagrid flatly .\\n “ Just have to find out for ourselves , then , ” said Ron , and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library .\\n They had indeed been searching books for Flamel’s name ever since Hagrid had let it slip , because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal ?\\n The trouble was , it was very hard to know where to begin , not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book .\\n He wasn’t in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century , or Notable Magical Names of Our Time he was missing , too , from Important Modern Magical Discoveries , and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry .\\n And then , of course , there was the sheer size of the library tens of thousands of books thousands of shelves hundreds of narrow rows .\\n Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random .\\n Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section .\\n He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn’t somewhere in there .\\n Unfortunately , you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books , and he knew he’d never get one .\\n These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts , and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts .\\n “ What are you looking for , boy ? ”\\n “ Nothing , ” said Harry .\\n Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him .\\n “ You’d better get out , then .\\n Go on out ! ”\\n Wishing he’d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story , Harry left the library .\\n He , Ron , and Hermione had already agreed they’d better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel .\\n They were sure she’d be able to tell them , but they couldn’t risk Snape hearing what they were up to .\\n Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything , but he wasn’t very hopeful .\\n They had been looking for two weeks , after all , but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn’t surprising they’d found nothing .\\n What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks .\\n Five minutes later , Ron and Hermione joined him , shaking their heads .\\n They went off to lunch .\\n “ You will keep looking while I’m away , won’t you ? ”\\n said Hermione .\\n “ And send me an owl if you find anything . ”\\n “ And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is , ” said Ron .\\n “ It’d be safe to ask them . ”\\n “ Very safe , as they’re both dentists , ” said Hermione .\\n Once the holidays had started , Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel .\\n They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual , so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire .\\n They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork bread , English muffins , marshmallows and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled , which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn’t work .\\n Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess .\\n This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive , which made it a lot like directing troops in battle .\\n Ron’s set was very old and battered .\\n Like everything else he owned , it had once belonged to someone else in his family in this case , his grandfather .\\n However , old chessmen weren’t a drawback at all .\\n Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted .\\n Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him , and they didn’t trust him at all .\\n He wasn’t a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him , which was confusing .\\n “ Don’t send me there , can’t you see his knight ?\\n Send him , we can afford to lose him . ”\\n On Christmas Eve , Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun , but not expecting any presents at all .\\n When he woke early in the morning , however , the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed .\\n “ Merry Christmas , ” said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe .\\n “ You , too , ” said Harry .\\n “ Will you look at this ?\\n I’ve got some presents ! ”\\n “ What did you expect , turnips ? ”\\n said Ron , turning to his own pile , which was a lot bigger than Harry’s .\\n Harry picked up the top parcel .\\n It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry , from Hagrid .\\n Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute .\\n Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself .\\n Harry blew it it sounded a bit like an owl .\\n A second , very small parcel contained a note .\\n We received your message and enclose your Christmas present .\\n From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia .\\n Taped to the note was a fifty pence piece .\\n “ That’s friendly , ” said Harry .\\n Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence .\\n “ Weird ” he said , “ What a shape !\\n This is money ? ”\\n “ You can keep it , ” said Harry , laughing at how pleased Ron was .\\n “ Hagrid and my aunt and uncle so who sent these ? ”\\n “ I think I know who that one’s from , ” said Ron , turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel .\\n “ My mom .\\n I told her you didn’t expect any presents and oh , no , ” he groaned , “ she’s made you a Weasley sweater . ”\\n Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick , hand knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge .\\n “ Every year she makes us a sweater , ” said Ron , unwrapping his own , “ and mine’s always maroon . ”\\n “ That’s really nice of her , ” said Harry , trying the fudge , which was very tasty .\\n His next present also contained candy a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione .\\n This only left one parcel .\\n Harry picked it up and felt it .\\n It was very light .\\n He unwrapped it .\\n Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds .\\n Ron gasped .\\n “ I’ve heard of those , ” he said in a hushed voice , dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he’d gotten from Hermione .\\n “ If that’s what I think it is they’re really rare , and really valuable . ”\\n “ What is it ? ”\\n Harry picked the shining , silvery cloth off the floor .\\n It was strange to the touch , like water woven into material .\\n “ It’s an Invisibility Cloak , ” said Ron , a look of awe on his face .\\n “ I’m sure it is try it on . ”\\n Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell .\\n “ It is !\\n Look down ! ”\\n Harry looked down at his feet , but they were gone .\\n He dashed to the mirror .\\n Sure enough , his reflection looked back at him , just his head suspended in midair , his body completely invisible .\\n He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely .\\n “ There’s a note ! ”\\n said Ron suddenly .\\n “ A note fell out of it ! ”\\n Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter .\\n Written in narrow , loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words : Your father left this in my possession before he died .\\n It is time it was returned to you .\\n Use it well .\\n A Very Merry Christmas to you .\\n There was no signature .\\n Harry stared at the note .\\n Ron was admiring the cloak .\\n “ I’d give anuthinq for one of these , ” he said .\\n “ Anuthinq .\\n What’s the matter ? ”\\n “ Nothing , ” said Harry .\\n He felt very strange .\\n Who had sent the cloak ?\\n Had it really once belonged to his father ?\\n Before he could say or think anything else , the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in .\\n Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight .\\n He didn’t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet .\\n “ Merry Christmas ! ”\\n “ Hey , look Harry’s got a Weasley sweater , too ! ”\\n Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters , one with a large yellow F on it , the other a G .\\n “ Harry’s is better than ours , though , ” said Fred , holding up Harry’s sweater .\\n “ She obviously makes more of an effort if you’re not family . ”\\n “ Why aren’t you wearing yours , Ron ? ”\\n George demanded .\\n “ Come on , get it on , they’re lovely and warm . ”\\n “ I hate maroon , ” Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head .\\n “ You haven’t got a letter on yours , ” George observed .\\n “ I suppose she thinks you don’t forget your name .\\n But we’re not stupid we know we’re called Gred and Forge . ”\\n “ What’s all this noise ? ”\\n Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door , looking disapproving .\\n He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he , too , carried a lumpy sweater over his arm , which Fred seized .\\n “ P for prefect !\\n Get it on , Percy , come on , we’re all wearing ours , even Harry got one . ”\\n “ I don’t want ” said Percy thickly , as the twins forced the sweater over his head , knocking his glasses askew .\\n “ And you’re not sitting with the prefects today , either , ” said George .\\n “ Christmas is a time for family . ”\\n They frog marched Percy from the room , his arms pinned to his side by his sweater .\\n Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner .\\n A hundred fat , roast turkeys mountains of roast and boiled potatoes platters of chipolatas tureens of buttered peas , silver boats of thick , rich gravy and cranberry sauce and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table .\\n These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought , with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside .\\n Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn’t just bang , it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke , while from the inside exploded a rear admiral’s hat and several live , white mice .\\n Up at the High Table , Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard’s hat for a flowered bonnet , and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him .\\n Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey .\\n Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver Sickle embedded in his slice .\\n Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine , finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek , who , to Harry’s amazement , giggled and blushed , her top hat lopsided .\\n When Harry finally left the table , he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers , including a pack of non explodable , luminous balloons , a Grow Your Own Warts kit , and his own new wizard chess set .\\n The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs Norris’s Christmas dinner .\\n Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds .\\n Then , cold , wet , and gasping for breath , they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room , where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron .\\n He suspected he wouldn’t have lost so badly if Percy hadn’t tried to help him so much .\\n After a meal of turkey sandwiches , crumpets , trifle , and Christmas cake , everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor Tower because they’d stolen his prefect badge .\\n It had been Harry’s best Christmas day ever .\\n Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day .\\n Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it : the Invisibility Cloak and whoever had sent it .\\n Ron , full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him , fell asleep almost as soon as he’d drawn the curtains of his four poster .\\n Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it .\\n His father’s this had been his father’s .\\n He let the material flow over his hands , smoother than silk , light as air .\\n Use it well , the note had said .\\n He had to try it , now .\\n He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself .\\n Looking down at his legs , he saw only moonlight and shadows .\\n It was a very funny feeling .\\n Use it well .\\n Suddenly , Harry felt wide awake .\\n The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak .\\n Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence .\\n He could go anywhere in this , anywhere , and Filch would never know .\\n Ron grunted in his sleep .\\n Should Harry wake him ?\\n Something held him back his father’s cloak he felt that this time the first time he wanted to use it alone .\\n He crept out of the dormitory , down the stairs , across the common room , and climbed through the portrait hole .\\n “ Who’s there ? ”\\n squawked the Fat Lady .\\n Harry said nothing .\\n He walked quickly down the corridor .\\n Where should he go ?\\n He stopped , his heart racing , and thought .\\n And then it came to him .\\n The Restricted Section in the library .\\n He’d be able to read as long as he liked , as long as it took to find out who Flamel was .\\n He set off , drawing the Invisibility Cloak tight around him as he walked .\\n The library was pitch black and very eerie .\\n Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books .\\n The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair , and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it , the sight gave him the creeps .\\n The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library .\\n Stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library , he held up his lamp to read the titles .\\n They didn’t tell him much .\\n Their peeling , faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn’t understand .\\n Some had no title at all .\\n One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood .\\n The hairs on the back of Harry’s neck prickled .\\n Maybe he was imagining it , maybe not , but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books , as though they knew someone was there who shouldn’t be .\\n He had to start somewhere .\\n Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor , he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting looking book .\\n A large black and silver volume caught his eye .\\n He pulled it out with difficulty , because it was very heavy , and , balancing it on his knee , let it fall open .\\n A piercing , bloodcurdling shriek split the silence the book was screaming !\\n Harry snapped it shut , but the shriek went on and on , one high , unbroken , earsplitting note .\\n He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp , which went out at once .\\n Panicking , he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf , he ran for it .\\n He passed Filch in the doorway Filch’s pale , wild eyes looked straight through him , and Harry slipped under Filch’s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor , the book’s shrieks still ringing in his ears .\\n He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor .\\n He had been so busy getting away from the library , he hadn’t paid attention to where he was going .\\n Perhaps because it was dark , he didn’t recognize where he was at all .\\n There was a suit of armor near the kitchens , he knew , but he must be five floors above there .\\n “ You asked me to come directly to you , Professor , if anyone was wandering around at night , and somebody’s been in the library Restricted Section . ”\\n Harry felt the blood drain out of his face .\\n Wherever he was , Filch must know a shortcut , because his soft , greasy voice was getting nearer , and to his horror , it was Snape who replied , “ The Restricted Section ?\\n Well , they can’t be far , we’ll catch them . ”\\n Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead .\\n They couldn’t see him , of course , but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they’d knock right into him the cloak didn’t stop him from being solid .\\n He backed away as quietly as he could .\\n A door stood ajar to his left .\\n It was his only hope .\\n He squeezed through it , holding his breath , trying not to move it , and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything .\\n They walked straight past , and Harry leaned against the wall , breathing deeply , listening to their footsteps dying away .\\n That had been close , very close .\\n It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in .\\n It looked like an unused classroom .\\n The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls , and there was an upturned wastepaper basket but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn’t look as if it belonged there , something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way .\\n It was a magnificent mirror , as high as the ceiling , with an ornate gold frame , standing on two clawed feet .\\n There was an inscription carved around the top : Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi .\\n His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape , Harry moved nearer to the mirror , wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again .\\n He stepped in front of it .\\n He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming .\\n He whirled around .\\n His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed for he had seen not only himself in the mirror , but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him .\\n But the room was empty .\\n Breathing very fast , he turned slowly back to the mirror .\\n There he was , reflected in it , white and scared looking , and there , reflected behind him , were at least ten others .\\n Harry looked over his shoulder but still , no one was there .\\n Or were they all invisible , too ?\\n Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirrors trick was that it reflected them , invisible or not ?\\n He looked in the mirror again .\\n A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving .\\n He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him .\\n If she was really there , he’d touch her , their reflections were so close together , but he felt only air she and the others existed only in the mirror .\\n She was a very pretty woman .\\n She had dark red hair and her eyes her eyes are just like mine , Harry thought , edging a little closer to the glass .\\n Bright green exactly the same shape , but then he noticed that she was crying smiling , but crying at the same time .\\n The tall , thin , black haired man standing next to her put his arm around her .\\n He wore glasses , and his hair was very untidy .\\n It stuck up at the back , just as Harry’s did .\\n Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection .\\n “ Mom ? ”\\n he whispered .\\n “ Dad ? ”\\n They just looked at him , smiling .\\n And slowly , Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror , and saw other pairs of green eyes like his , other noses like his , even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry’s knobbly knees Harry was looking at his family , for the first time in his life .\\n The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them , his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them .\\n He had a powerful kind of ache inside him , half joy , half terrible sadness .\\n How long he stood there , he didn’t know .\\n The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses .\\n He couldn’t stay here , he had to find his way back to bed .\\n He tore his eyes away from his mother’s face , whispered , “ I’ll come back , ” and hurried from the room .\\n “ You could have woken me up , ” said Ron , crossly .\\n “ You can come tonight , I’m going back , I want to show you the mirror . ”\\n “ I’d like to see your mom and dad , ” Ron said eagerly .\\n “ And I want to see all your family , all the Weasleys , you’ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone . ”\\n “ You can see them any old time , ” said Ron .\\n “ Just come round my house this summer .\\n Anyway , maybe it only shows dead people .\\n Shame about not finding Flamel , though .\\n Have some bacon or something , why aren’t you eating anything ? ”\\n Harry couldn’t eat .\\n He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight .\\n He had almost forgotten about Flamel .\\n It didn’t seem very important anymore .\\n Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding ?\\n What did it matter if Snape stole it , really ?\\n “ Are you all right ? ”\\n said Ron .\\n “ You look odd . ”\\n What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again .\\n With Ron covered in the cloak , too , they had to walk much more slowly the next night .\\n They tried retracing Harry’s route from the library , wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour .\\n “ I’m freezing , ” said Ron .\\n “ Let’s forget it and go back . ”\\n “ IVo ! ”\\n Harry hissed .\\n “ I know it’s here somewhere . ”\\n They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction , but saw no one else .\\n Just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold , Harry spotted the suit of armor .\\n “ It’s here just here yes ! ”\\n They pushed the door open .\\n Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror .\\n There they were .\\n His mother and father beamed at the sight of him .\\n “ See ? ”\\n Harry whispered .\\n “ I can’t see anything . ”\\n “ Look !\\n Look at them all there are loads of them . ”\\n “ I can only see you . ”\\n “ Look in it properly , go on , stand where I am . ”\\n Harry stepped aside , but with Ron in front of the mirror , he couldn’t see his family anymore , just Ron in his paisley pajamas .\\n Ron , though , was staring transfixed at his image .\\n “ Look at me ! ”\\n he said .\\n “ Can you see all your family standing around you ? ”\\n “ No I’m alone but I’m different I look older and I’m Head Boy ! ”\\n “ What ? ”\\n “ I am I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to and I’m holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup I’m Quidditch captain , too ! ”\\n Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry .\\n “ Do you think this mirror shows the future ? ”\\n “ How can it ?\\n All my family are dead let me have another look ” “ You had it to yourself all last night , give me a bit more time . ”\\n “ You’re only holding the Quidditch Cup , what’s interesting about that ?\\n I want to see my parents . ”\\n “ Don’t push me ” A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion .\\n They hadn’t realized how loudly they had been talking .\\n “ Quick ! ”\\n Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs Norris came round the door .\\n Ron and Harry stood quite still , both thinking the same thing did the cloak work on cats ?\\n After what seemed an age , she turned and left .\\n “ This isn’t safe she might have gone for Filch , I bet she heard us .\\n Come on . ”\\n And Ron pulled Harry out of the room .\\n The snow still hadn’t melted the next morning .\\n “ Want to play chess , Harry ? ”\\n said Ron .\\n “ No . ”\\n “ Why don’t we go down and visit Hagrid ? ”\\n “ No you go ” “ I know what you’re thinking about , Harry , that mirror .\\n Don’t go back tonight . ”\\n “ Why not ? ”\\n “ I dunno , I’ve just got a bad feeling about it and anyway , you’ve had too many close shaves already .\\n Filch , Snape , and Mrs Norris are wandering around .\\n So what if they can’t see you ?\\n What if they walk into you ?\\n What if you knock something over ? ”\\n “ You sound like Hermione . ”\\n “ I’m serious , Harry , don’t go . ”\\n But Harry only had one thought in his head , which was to get back in front of the mirror , and Ron wasn’t going to stop him .\\n That third night he found his way more quickly than before .\\n He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise , but he didn’t meet anyone .\\n And there were his mother and father smiling at him again , and one of his grandfathers nodding happily .\\n Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror .\\n There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family .\\n Nothing at all .\\n Except “ So back again , Harry ? ”\\n Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice .\\n He looked behind him .\\n Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore .\\n Harry must have walked straight past him , so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn’t noticed him .\\n “ I I didn’t see you , sir . ”\\n “ Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you , ” said Dumbledore , and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling .\\n “ So , ” said Dumbledore , slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry , “ you , like hundreds before you , have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised . ”\\n “ I didn’t know it was called that , sir . ”\\n “ But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does ? ”\\n “ It well it shows me my family ” “ And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy . ”\\n “ How did you know ? ”\\n “ I don’t need a cloak to become invisible , ” said Dumbledore gently .\\n “ Now , can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all ? ”\\n Harry shook his head .\\n “ Let me explain .\\n The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror , that is , he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is .\\n Does that help ? ”\\n Harry thought .\\n Then he said slowly , “ It shows us what we want whatever we want ” “ Yes and no , ” said Dumbledore quietly .\\n “ It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest , most desperate desire of our hearts .\\n You , who have never known your family , see them standing around you .\\n Ronald Weasley , who has always been overshadowed by his brothers , sees himself standing alone , the best of all of them .\\n However , this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth .\\n Men have wasted away before it , entranced by what they have seen , or been driven mad , not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible .\\n “ The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow , Harry , and I ask you not to go looking for it again .\\n If you ever do run across it , you will now be prepared .\\n It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live , remember that .\\n Now , why don’t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed ? ”\\n Harry stood up .\\n “ Sir Professor Dumbledore ?\\n Can I ask you something ? ”\\n “ Obviously , you’ve just done so , ” Dumbledore smiled .\\n “ You may ask me one more thing , however . ”\\n “ What do you see when you look in the mirror ? ”\\n “ I ?\\n I see myself holding a pair of thick , woolen socks . ”\\n Harry stared .\\n “ One can never have enough socks , ” said Dumbledore .\\n “ Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn’t get a single pair .\\n People will insist on giving me books . ”\\n It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful .\\n But then , he thought , as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow , it had been quite a personal question .',\n",
       "   'Chapter : HALLOWEEN .\\n Malfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day , looking tired but perfectly cheerful .\\n Indeed , by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three headed dog had been an excellent adventure , and they were quite keen to have another one .\\n In the meantime , Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts , and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection .\\n “ It’s either really valuable or really dangerous , ” said Ron .\\n “ Or both , ” said Harry .\\n But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long , they didn’t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues .\\n Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor .\\n All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again .\\n Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron , but she was such a bossy know it all that they saw this as an added bonus .\\n All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy , and to their great delight , just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later .\\n As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual , everyone’s attention was caught at once by a long , thin package carried by six large screech owls .\\n Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel , and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him , knocking his bacon to the floor .\\n They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel .\\n Harry ripped open the letter first , which was lucky , because it said : DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE .\\n It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand , but I don’t want everybody knowing you’ve got a broomstick or they’ll all want one .\\n Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o’clock for your first training session .\\n Professor M .\\n McGonagall Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read .\\n “ A Nimbus Two Thousand ! ”\\n Ron moaned enviously .\\n “ I’ve never even touched one . ”\\n They left the hall quickly , wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class , but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle .\\n Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it .\\n “ That’s a broomstick , ” he said , throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face .\\n “ You’ll be in for it this time , Potter , first years aren’t allowed them . ”\\n Ron couldn’t resist it .\\n “ It’s not any old broomstick , ” he said , “ it’s a Nimbus Two Thousand .\\n What did you say you’ve got at home , Malfoy , a Comet Two Sixty ? ”\\n Ron grinned at Harry .\\n “ Comets look flashy , but they’re not in the same league as the Nimbus . ”\\n “ What would you know about it , Weasley , you couldn’t afford half the handle , ” Malfoy snapped back .\\n “ I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig . ”\\n Before Ron could answer , Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy’s elbow .\\n “ Not arguing , I hope , boys ? ”\\n he squeaked .\\n “ Potters been sent a broomstick , Professor , ” said Malfoy quickly .\\n “ Yes , yes , that’s right , ” said Professor Flitwick , beaming at Harry .\\n “ Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances , Potter .\\n And what model is it ? ”\\n “ A Nimbus Two Thousand , sir , ” said Harry , fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy’s face .\\n “ And it’s really thanks to Malfoy here that I’ve got it , ” he added .\\n Harry and Ron headed upstairs , smothering their laughter at Malfoy’s obvious rage and confusion .\\n “ Well , it’s true , ” Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase , “ If he hadn’t stolen Neville’s Remembrall I wouldn’t be on the team . ”\\n “ So I suppose you think that’s a reward for breaking rules ? ”\\n came an angry voice from just behind them .\\n Hermione was stomping up the stairs , looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry’s hand .\\n “ I thought you weren’t speaking to us ? ”\\n said Harry .\\n “ Yes , don’t stop now , ” said Ron , “ it’s doing us so much good . ”\\n Hermione marched away with her nose in the air .\\n Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day .\\n It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed , or straying off to the Quidditch field where he’d be learning to play that night .\\n He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating , and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last .\\n “ Wow , ” Ron sighed , as the broomstick rolled onto Harry’s bedspread .\\n Even Harry , who knew nothing about the different brooms , thought it looked wonderful .\\n Sleek and shiny , with a mahogany handle , it had a long tail of neat , straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top .\\n As seven o’clock drew nearer , Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field .\\n He’d never been inside the stadium before .\\n Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on .\\n At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end .\\n They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through , except that they were fifty feet high .\\n Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood , Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground .\\n What a feeling he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field .\\n The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch .\\n “ Hey , Potter , come down ! ”\\n Oliver Wood had arrived .\\n He was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm .\\n Harry landed next to him .\\n “ Very nice , ” said Wood , his eyes glinting .\\n “ I see what McGonagall meant you really are a natural .\\n I’m just going to teach you the rules this evening , then you’ll be joining team practice three times a week . ”\\n He opened the crate .\\n Inside were four different sized balls .\\n “ Right , ” said Wood .\\n “ Now , Quidditch is easy enough to understand , even if it’s not too easy to play .\\n There are seven players on each side .\\n Three of them are called Chasers . ”\\n “ Three Chasers , ” Harry repeated , as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball .\\n “ This ball’s called the Quaffle , ” said Wood .\\n “ The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal .\\n Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops .\\n Follow me ? ”\\n “ The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score , ” Harry recited .\\n “ So that’s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops , isn’t it ? ”\\n “ What’s basketball ? ”\\n said Wood curiously .\\n “ Never mind , ” said Harry quickly .\\n “ Now , there’s another player on each side who’s called the Keeper I’m Keeper for Gryffindor .\\n I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring . ”\\n “ Three Chasers , one Keeper , ” said Harry , who was determined to remember it all .\\n “ And they play with the Quaffle .\\n Okay , got that .\\n So what are they for ? ”\\n He pointed at the three balls left inside the box .\\n “ I’ll show you now , ” said Wood .\\n “ Take this . ”\\n He handed Harry a small club , a bit like a short baseball bat .\\n “ I’m going to show you what the Bludgers do , ” Wood said .\\n “ These two are the Bludgers . ”\\n He showed Harry two identical balls , jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle .\\n Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box .\\n “ Stand back , ” Wood warned Harry .\\n He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers .\\n At once , the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry’s face .\\n Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose , and sent it zigzagging away into the air it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood , who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground .\\n “ See ? ”\\n Wood panted , forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely .\\n “ The Bludgers rocket around , trying to knock players off their brooms .\\n That’s why you have two Beaters on each team the Weasley twins are ours it’s their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team .\\n So think you’ve got all that ? ”\\n “ Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle the Keeper guards the goal posts the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team , ” Harry reeled off .\\n “ Very good , ” said Wood .\\n “ Er have the Bludgers ever killed anyone ? ”\\n Harry asked , hoping he sounded offhand .\\n “ Never at Hogwarts .\\n We’ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that .\\n Now , the last member of the team is the Seeker .\\n That’s you .\\n And you don’t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers ” “ unless they crack my head open . ”\\n “ Don’t worry , the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers I mean , they’re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves . ”\\n Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball .\\n Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers , it was tiny , about the size of a large walnut .\\n It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings .\\n “ This , ” said Wood , “ is the Golden Snitch , and it’s the most important ball of the lot .\\n It’s very hard to catch because it’s so fast and difficult to see .\\n It’s the Seeker’s job to catch it .\\n You’ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers , Beaters , Bludgers , and Quaffle to get it before the other team’s Seeker , because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points , so they nearly always win .\\n That’s why Seekers get fouled so much .\\n A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught , so it can go on for ages I think the record is three months , they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep .\\n “ Well , that’s it any questions ? ”\\n Harry shook his head .\\n He understood what he had to do all right , it was doing it that was going to be the problem .\\n “ We won’t practice with the Snitch yet , ” said Wood , carefully shutting it back inside the crate , “ it’s too dark , we might lose it .\\n Let’s try you out with a few of these . ”\\n He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later , he and Harry were up in the air , Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch .\\n Harry didn’t miss a single one , and Wood was delighted .\\n After half an hour , night had really fallen and they couldn’t carry on .\\n “ That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year , ” said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle .\\n “ I wouldn’t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley , and he could have played for England if he hadn’t gone off chasing dragons . ”\\n Perhaps it was because he was now so busy , what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework , but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he’d already been at Hogwarts two months .\\n The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had .\\n His lessons , too , were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics .\\n On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors .\\n Even better , Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly , something they had all been dying to try since they’d seen him make Neville’s toad zoom around the classroom .\\n Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice .\\n Harry’s partner was Seamus Finnigan ( which was a relief , because Neville had been trying to catch his eye ) .\\n Ron , however , was to be working with Hermione Granger .\\n It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this .\\n She hadn’t spoken to either of them since the day Harry’s broomstick had arrived .\\n “ Now , don’t forget that nice wrist movement we’ve been practicing ! ”\\n squeaked Professor Flitwick , perched on top of his pile of books as usual .\\n “ Swish and flick , remember , swish and flick .\\n And saying the magic words properly is very important , too never forget Wizard Baruffio , who said ‘ s ’ instead of ‘ f and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest . ”\\n It was very difficult .\\n Harry and Seamus swished and flicked , but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop .\\n Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it Harry had to put it out with his hat .\\n Ron , at the next table , wasn’t having much more luck .\\n “ Wingardium Leviosal ” he shouted , waving his long arms like a windmill .\\n “ You’re saying it wrong , ” Harry heard Hermione snap .\\n “ It’s Wing gar dium Levi o sa , make the ‘ gar ’ nice and long . ”\\n “ You do it , then , if you’re so clever , ” Ron snarled .\\n Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown , flicked her wand , and said , “ Wingardium LeviosaV ’ Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads .\\n “ Oh , well done ! ”\\n cried Professor Flitwick , clapping .\\n “ Everyone see here , Miss Granger’s done it ! ”\\n Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class .\\n “ It’s no wonder no one can stand her , ” he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor , “ she’s a nightmare , honestly . ”\\n Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him .\\n It was Hermione .\\n Harry caught a glimpse of her face and was startled to see that she was in tears .\\n “ I think she heard you . ”\\n “ So ? ”\\n said Ron , but he looked a bit uncomfortable .\\n “ She must’ve noticed she’s got no friends . ”\\n Hermione didn’t turn up for the next class and wasn’t seen all afternoon .\\n On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast , Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls ’ bathroom and wanted to be left alone .\\n Ron looked still more awkward at this , but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall , where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds .\\n A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds , making the candles in the pumpkins stutter .\\n The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates , as it had at the start of term banquet .\\n Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall , his turban askew and terror on his face .\\n Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore’s chair , slumped against the table , and gasped , “ Troll in the dungeons thought you ought to know . ”\\n He then sank to the floor in a dead faint .\\n There was an uproar .\\n It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore’s wand to bring silence .\\n “ Prefects , ” he rumbled , “ lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately ! ”\\n Percy was in his element .\\n “ Follow me !\\n Stick together , first years !\\n No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders !\\n Stay close behind me , now .\\n Make way , first years coming through !\\n Excuse me , I’m a prefect ! ”\\n “ How could a troll get in ? ”\\n Harry asked as they climbed the stairs .\\n “ Don’t ask me , they’re supposed to be really stupid , ” said Ron .\\n “ Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke . ”\\n They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions .\\n As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs , Harry suddenly grabbed Ron’s arm .\\n “ I’ve just thought Hermione . ”\\n “ What about her ? ”\\n “ She doesn’t know about the troll . ”\\n Ron bit his lip .\\n “ Oh , all right , ” he snapped .\\n “ But Percy’d better not see us . ”\\n Ducking down , they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way , slipped down a deserted side corridor , and hurried off toward the girls ’ bathroom .\\n They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them .\\n “ Percy ! ”\\n hissed Ron , pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin .\\n Peering around it , however , they saw not Percy but Snape .\\n He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view .\\n “ What’s he doing ? ”\\n Harry whispered .\\n “ Why isn’t he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers ? ”\\n “ Search me . ”\\n Quietly as possible , they crept along the next corridor after Snape ’ s fading footsteps .\\n “ He’s heading for the third floor , ” Harry said , but Ron held up his hand .\\n “ Can you smell something ? ”\\n Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils , a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean .\\n And then they heard it a low grunting , and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet .\\n Ron pointed at the end of a passage to the left , something huge was moving toward them .\\n They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight .\\n It was a horrible sight .\\n Twelve feet tall , its skin was a dull , granite gray , its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut .\\n It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat , horny feet .\\n The smell coming from it was incredible .\\n It was holding a huge wooden club , which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long .\\n The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside .\\n It waggled its long ears , making up its tiny mind , then slouched slowly into the room .\\n “ The key’s in the lock , ” Harry muttered .\\n “ We could lock it in . ”\\n “ Good idea , ” said Ron nervously .\\n They edged toward the open door , mouths dry , praying the troll wasn’t about to come out of it .\\n With one great leap , Harry managed to grab the key , slam the door , and lock it .\\n “ Yes ! ”\\n Flushed with their victory , they started to run back up the passage , but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop a high , petrified scream and it was coming from the chamber they’d just chained up .\\n “ Oh , no , ” said Ron , pale as the Bloody Baron .\\n “ It’s the girls ’ bathroom ! ”\\n Harry gasped .\\n “ Hermionel ” they said together .\\n It was the last thing they wanted to do , but what choice did they have ?\\n Wheeling around , they sprinted back to the door and turned the key , fumbling in their panic .\\n Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside .\\n Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite , looking as if she was about to faint .\\n The troll was advancing on her , knocking the sinks off the walls as it went .\\n “ Confuse it ! ”\\n Harry said desperately to Ron , and , seizing a tap , he threw it as hard as he could against the wall .\\n The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione .\\n It lumbered around , blinking stupidly , to see what had made the noise .\\n Its mean little eyes saw Harry .\\n It hesitated , then made for him instead , lifting its club as it went .\\n “ Oy , pea brain ! ”\\n yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber , and he threw a metal pipe at it .\\n The troll didn’t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder , but it heard the yell and paused again , turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead , giving Harry time to run around it .\\n “ Come on , run , run ” Harry yelled at Hermione , trying to pull her toward the door , but she couldn’t move , she was still flat against the wall , her mouth open with terror .\\n The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk .\\n It roared again and started toward Ron , who was nearest and had no way to escape .\\n Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid : He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll’s neck from behind .\\n The troll couldn’t feel Harry hanging there , but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose , and Harry’s wand had still been in his hand when he’d jumped it had gone straight up one of the troll’s nostrils .\\n Howling with pain , the troll twisted and flailed its club , with Harry clinging on for dear life any second , the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club .\\n Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright Ron pulled out his own wand not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head : “ Wingardium Leviosal ” The club flew suddenly out of the troll’s hand , rose high , high up into the air , turned slowly over and dropped , with a sickening crack , onto its owner’s head .\\n The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face , with a thud that made the whole room tremble .\\n Harry got to his feet .\\n He was shaking and out of breath .\\n Ron was standing there with his wand still raised , staring at what he had done .\\n It was Hermione who spoke first .\\n “ Is it dead ? ”\\n “ I don’t think so , ” said Harry , “ I think it’s just been knocked out . ”\\n He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll’s nose .\\n It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue .\\n “ Urgh troll boogers . ”\\n He wiped it on the troll’s trousers .\\n A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up .\\n They hadn’t realized what a racket they had been making , but of course , someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll’s roars .\\n A moment later , Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room , closely followed by Snape , with Quirrell bringing up the rear .\\n Quirrell took one look at the troll , let out a faint whimper , and sat quickly down on a toilet , clutching his heart .\\n Snape bent over the troll .\\n Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry .\\n Harry had never seen her look so angry .\\n Her lips were white .\\n Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry’s mind .\\n “ What on earth were you thinking of ? ”\\n said Professor McGonagall , with cold fury in her voice .\\n Harry looked at Ron , who was still standing with his wand in the air .\\n “ You’re lucky you weren’t killed .\\n Why aren’t you in your dormitory ? ”\\n Snape gave Harry a swift , piercing look .\\n Harry looked at the floor .\\n He wished Ron would put his wand down .\\n Then a small voice came out of the shadows .\\n “ Please , Professor McGonagall they were looking for me . ”\\n “ Miss Granger ! ”\\n Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last .\\n “ I went looking for the troll because I I thought I could deal with it on my own you know , because I’ve read all about them . ”\\n Ron dropped his wand .\\n Hermione Granger , telling a downright lie to a teacher ?\\n “ If they hadn’t found me , I’d be dead now .\\n Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club .\\n They didn’t have time to come and fetch anyone .\\n It was about to finish me off when they arrived . ”\\n Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn’t new to them .\\n “ Well in that case ” said Professor McGonagall , staring at the three of them , “ Miss Granger , you foolish girl , how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own ? ”\\n Hermione hung her head .\\n Harry was speechless .\\n Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules , and here she was , pretending she had , to get them out of trouble .\\n It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets .\\n “ Miss Granger , five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this , ” said Professor McGonagall .\\n “ I’m very disappointed in you .\\n If you’re not hurt at all , you’d better get off to Gryffindor Tower .\\n Students are finishing the feast in their Houses . ”\\n Hermione left .\\n Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron .\\n “ Well , I still say you were lucky , but not many first years could have taken on a full grown mountain troll .\\n You each win Gryffindor five points .\\n Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this .\\n You may go . ”\\n They hurried out of the chamber and didn’t speak at all until they had climbed two floors up .\\n It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll , quite apart from anything else .\\n “ We should have gotten more than ten points , ” Ron grumbled .\\n “ Five , you mean , once she’s taken off Hermione ’ s . ”\\n “ Good of her to get us out of trouble like that , ” Ron admitted .\\n “ Mind you , we did save her . ”\\n “ She might not have needed saving if we hadn’t locked the thing in with her , ” Harry reminded him .\\n They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady .\\n “ Pig snout , ” they said and entered .\\n The common room was packed and noisy .\\n Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up .\\n Hermione , however , stood alone by the door , waiting for them .\\n There was a very embarrassed pause .\\n Then , none of them looking at each other , they all said “ Thanks , ” and hurried off to get plates .\\n But from that moment on , Hermione Granger became their friend .\\n There are some things you can’t share without ending up liking each other , and knocking out a twelve foot mountain troll is one of them .']]}"
